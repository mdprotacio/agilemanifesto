The biggest possible challenge which Agile will encounter is the organizatinal change, it demands for execution of projects. The best part of this is the staisfaction a development team gets by many frequent functional releases giving them a feel of meeting the targets very often.<hr>

<b>Nelson Perez</b>:  (<a href="http://www.sierrasedge.com">Sierra's Edge, Inc.</a>) The Agile Manifesto has captured in elegant style the fundamental underpinnings of the essence of successful programming.  While there are many best practices frameworks out there, none have been able to model how successful projects really happen while I believe the Agile Manifesto is a step in the right direction.  It still takes talent and experience to make good products but this will always be the case.<hr>

<a href="mailto:email@jessefewell.com">Jesse Fewell</a>:  (<a href="http://www.jessefewell.com">http://www.jessefewell.com</a>) Conventional Project Management is based on preventing failure, rather than maximizing value. What if we focused on value instead? What if we sought to understand our customers instead of subjecting them to process documents? What if we empowered our workers through service-leadership, rather than oppress them through command-and-control? What if management excellence is measured by results, rather than performance-to-plan? Well then, we may just have a revolution that can transform the workplace and transform business.<hr>

<b>Andy Naessens</b>:  (<a href="http://www.teklarity.net">TeKlarity</a>) I have been an avid practitioner of the AGILE methodologies since the Manifesto inception and prior to it origins, dating back to 1996 with my first successes delivering projects with Iterative and Incremental Development practices and principles.

I now see AGILE as taken a strong foothold in breaking down the “walls” and roadblock presented by “waterfallish” practices.

I thank the original 17 signers of the Manifesto and will continue to strive in carrying and following these practices and principles throughout my career.

I have yet to work for an organization that embraces these principles, but I continue to work to instill them wherever I&#39;m at. It&#39;s nice to know that I&#39;m not alone. <hr>
<a href="mailto:hueyware@nc.rr.com">Harold 'Huey' Hoague</a>: I apparently have been following a the Agile methodology for a couple of years now, or at least real close to it. I put my handcock here to make it official and kudos for actually putting these to paper (well elctronic paper anyway).<hr>
<b>Elliot Gerberg</b>: In my role as Vice President of Engineering in a number firms, and from my early experience as a software engineer I wish to strongly endorse your Agile Manifesto. These guiding principles of software creation and product development are too often not recognized as &quot;the best balance of business goals and engineering goals&quot;. Collaborative, iterative, and flexible models of engineering software are in my experience the only way to proceed. While this is not to say 
&quot;you have defined the only true software development religion&quot;, I really believe you have captured much of the essense of how to manage software development. Best of luck in continuing to refine these ideas. - Elliot Gerberg (elliotgerberg@comcast.net)<hr>

<a href="mailto:trond.stroemme@wanadoo.fr">Trond Strömme</a>: You could adopt these principles to all aspects of life, and it would make sense. Perfect sense.<hr>
<b>Thomas Robbertse</b>:  (moneysupermarket.com) It is all about doing the right thing, at the right time, for the right reason!

Focus, focus, focus, and a lot of people says a lot of things, and although it is quite important to listen what they say, one also has to question what is not said:... for the things not said could be deliberate or by omission due to a lack of attention to detail, and may cost dearly if discovered later down the line!<hr>

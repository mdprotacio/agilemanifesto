<a href="mailto:juan.bernabo@gmail.com">Juan Bernabo</a>:  (<a href="http://www.teamware.com.br">TeamWare</a>) I support this manifest and the agile movement as I firmly believe that we have the oportunity of delivering more value by unleashing people pontential, talents and creativity than by controlling, creating rules, defining specifics tasks, etc. 

Agile processes are an &quot;Information Age&quot; response to the limitations that &quot;Industrial Age&quot; inspired processes have had on software development.<hr>

<b>Florin Baiduc</b>: I am an open-source programmer, Linux (with it&#39;s many flavours) supporter.<hr>
<a href="mailto:oclaros1@hotmail.com">Oscar Claros</a>: Agile and Xtreme Programing leads customers and management into thinking what the REAL requirements are and what are their ACTUAL needs and thus aids me in creating better unit tests and developing clear and concise code.<hr>
<a href="mailto:rsingh6@sapient.com">Rishabh</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sapient.com">Sapient Corporation</a>) Agile IS the way to go... in today&#39;s time when customers demand dizzying speed to market and business value out of their solutions to the maximum extent possible, it is undeniable that conventional methodologies have been recently failing big time in meeting these objectives. AGILE is here to stay, and fine people like us are fully committed to constantly make it happen and embed it in the IT community as a discipline and definitive direction.<hr>

<b>Jawed Nazar Ali</b>:  (<a href="http://www.globalnorthstar.com">Global Northstar Technologies, Inc</a>) I would like to know more about this manifesto; and also would love to support in any means to achieve this goal.

I have observed that we are lacking such methodologies, which is causing lots of problems when we have to deliver large functionality in limited amount of time.

Thanks,

<b>Douglas Carpenter</b>:  (State Of Alaska) <hr>
<b>Jeff Luminais</b>: Software by its very nature was designed to permit flexibility and adaptibility.  Too often, the paradigm for designing large, physical entities is applied to software design.  Although up front planning and thought should be given to any project, it should not be the only design constraint.  Planning and design documents are important, but more so for historical perspective rather than &quot;the bible&quot; for a software design.  A document can never represent the sum total of human thought and experience.<hr>
<a href="mailto:gurkan@nisanci.org">Gurkan Nisanci</a>:  (<a href="http://htttp://www.nisanci.org">Software Developer</a>) I believe in the power of Agile methods and use them heavily in every software development work I am doing.<hr>

<b>Dirk Maes</b>:  (IBM) What other options do we have?<hr>
<b>Paul Massey</b>:  (<a href="http://www.absolute-software.co.uk">Absolute Software Ltd</a>) I think the Agile Manifesto is great. I&#39;d like to see it applied more to embedded programming.<hr>
<b>Paul Lorett Amazona</b>:  (<a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/xreverb">http://www.mp3.com.au/xreverb</a>) sometimes we just can&#39;t avoid change... at least somehow, we respond to it in the best way we can...<hr>
<a href="mailto:tai.truong@qnamic.com">Tai Truong</a>:  (<a href="http://www.qnamic.com">qnamic - Intelligent Resource Management</a>) It&#39;s unbelievable. We (from qnamic) thought we are the only one believing that:

- (fast acting) on changes goes over contracts
- working software goes over documentation
- the believe in the people and the team and its dynamic interaction goes over static, defined development processes and tools
- rather an evolving prototyping fulfills customer acceptance and requirements than any contract can guarantee 

Many people, theorists and know-it-alls doesn&#39;t agree with us, left us or rely on their old-fashioned, waterfall model approaches.

BUT our customers have such a faith in us (it is sometimes even scary that they think of what and when we are capable of).

AND there are other people making EXACTLY the same experience like we do!

We support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>

<a href="mailto:ilia@mogilevsky.com.au">Ilia Mogilevsky</a>: After working with the strict Waterfall model, I have come to realise that Agile methodologies are better suited for projects with quality developers.

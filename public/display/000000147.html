We always need to be able to respond to change because it&#39;s inevitable, especially in Government due to cyclical nature.  I certainly hope I can make a difference in providing a better product to our customers utilizing Agile.  I really think you&#39;re on the right track.  Regina Coleman, IT Specialist, USDA<hr>

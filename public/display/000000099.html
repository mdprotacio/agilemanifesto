Find a process that works for your team and satisfies the manifesto and, guess what, you&#39;re doing Agile Software Development!  <hr>

<b>Chris Brookins</b>:  (<a href="http://www.vertical.com">Vertical Communicationsq</a>) I signed the Agile Manifesto because it puts a laser focus on the key points of excellence in software development.  <hr>

<b>Paolo Rainone</b>:  (<a href="http://www.codentropy.com">http://www.codentropy.com</a>) Software Development State of Art is far from perfect...and in this stormy ocean of imperfect, error-prone, money-wasting, time-wasting processes, Agile Manifesto is a bright lightouse that help to drive out the darkness.<hr>
<b>Travis Jensen</b>:  (<a href="http://cmssphere.blogspot.com">http://cmssphere.blogspot.com</a>) I have spent years on projects recovering from the pain inflicted by over-engineering.  I have also lost years (of my life) dealing with figuring out what a project is supposed to be at the expense of implementing the project.  I&#39;ve also been successful when working in small , focused teams in highly iterative environments.  Software has a purpose and should be built to that purpose, and nothing more.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mpleahy@gemteam.com">Michael Patrick Leahy</a>:  (<a href="http://www.gemteam.com">Guerrilla Enterprise</a>) The Agile Manifesto provides a common sense and practical approach to cost effective software development. The concepts can be applied to all types of project management.<hr>

<b>Donna Kensy-Rudick</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:dave@davefuller.net">David Fuller</a>:  (David Fuller Consulting) I started in this business a long time ago and the only thing I&#39;ve figured out so far is that we now have the tools to communicate.

It&#39;s all about moving the blocks ahead.

While I am not completely familiar with this, organically I know it works.  

I would suggest Joseph Weizenbaum&#39;s &quot;Computer Power and Human Reason&quot; as a precursor.

<a href="mailto:machicoane@computer.org">MACHICOANE Thierry</a>:  (<a href="http://software.challenge.googlepages.com/">http://software.challenge.googlepages.com/</a>) As stated by Andy Boynton and Bill Fischer in their book about Virtuoso Teams: « It sounds simple, but the ingredients for virtuoso teams are rarely assembled in most organizations: they are considered &quot;too risky, too temperamental, too egocentric, and too difficult to control.&quot; These are typical phrases one often heards whenever putting great talent on one team is considered. ». Here lies our key challenge !<hr>
<a href="mailto:moliver@corenttech.com">Michael Oliver</a>:  (<a href="http://www.corenttech.com">Corent Technology</a>) I believe that the principles written herein are the proper values and that software that is more about these values and less about the technology will almost always work better to solve the problems the business person is trying to solve.<hr>
<a href="mailto:michael@fuchs20.de">Michael Fuchs</a>:  (<a href="http://www.fuchs20.de">Fuchs20 Software Engineering</a>) Thank you, for writing down these important statements. 
In most areas these is the right way to develop and to work. 
We have to keep care that bureaucratism is not sweeping away the creative impulse and the fun to work.
It feels like coming back to the roots.<hr>
<a href="mailto:adam@tameware.com">Adam Wildavsky</a>:  (<a href="http://www.tameware.com">Google, Inc.</a>) I was sold on Agile after I read &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; in 2000. The thing that impressed me most was that it seemed to address 90% of the reasons I&#39;d seen projects fail. It gave me permission to do some things I&#39;d been doing already, but had felt guilty about, and showed me how to fill in gaps in my practices I hadn&#39;t realized were there. <hr>
<a href="mailto:olivier.costa@aegisoft.be">Costa Olivier</a>:  (<a href="http://www.aegisoft.be">AEGISoft bvba</a>) I&#39;m very gratefull for the agile movement providing me with such a clear platform to give my ideas about software more maturity.

thank you for your courage &amp; persistance !<hr>

<b>Stefan Steinert</b>: I (too) consider these to be important factors for software development. Or even for overall project attitude.<hr>

<b>Gabriel Le Van</b>: Agile Manifesto engage software development in the way of sustainable development. Time and energy must be spend on useful and efficient items.<hr>

Stakic</b>:  (<a href="http://www.AdvancedSystemsGuild.com">Advanced Systems Guild</a>) In retrospective, all the successful projects I was involved in were aligned with these principles.  Thank you for formulating and promoting them, bringing them into the mainstream practice. <hr>
<b>Endre Sándor Varga</b>:  (<a href="http://www.bme.hu">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>) Any ideology that is forced on the world instead of taylored to the world always leads to brainwashing and dictatory. Avoid idealists and team with people who admit that change and adaption is unavoidable. Be agile.<hr>
<b>Sola Lee</b>:  (<a href="http://madtech.com.my">Mad Technologies</a>) We started our business 4 years back struggling for the best development methodology for our unique Sarawakian mentality... until we discovered Agile. We customize agile with the manifesto as our framework.

From that moment onward there is no turning back.... we rather spent a day &quot;educating&quot; our clients on agile then to run the project without agile. 

Agile is the only methodology I know that can be use as a sell and marketing strategy.

Agile methodology made us what we are today.<hr>
<b>Stuart Rodgers</b>:  (<a href="http://www.agstechnet.com">AGS TechNet</a>) The Manifesto reflects the simple and elegant truth that RESULTS are always more important than process.  
Fans of process will argue that better processes lead to better results.  I suppose they might be right sometimes. But I cannot think of an instance where failure was lauded because the &quot;right&quot; process was followed....<hr>
<b>Timur Lazarenko</b>:  (<a href="http://www.quazar-studio.com">Quazar Studio</a>) Great tendention for making great things.<hr>
<b>Travis Cook</b>:  (<a href="http://www.solutionstream.com">SolutionStream</a>) These kinds of principles have been life savers!  We design and develop software every day and these principles are the difference between success and failure.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tomas@tril.cz">Tomas Vlk</a>:  (Tril s.r.o.) Yes, I have the same experience. We use Test Driven Development three years and it is amazing.                                                                                           <hr>
<a href="mailto:hans.verstraelen@isonova.nl">Hans Verstraelen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.isonova.nl">Isonova</a>) After 25 years of embedded software development, going through all the software process improvement theories, having tried numerous great methods, watching time and budgets being waisted for the sake of the process, I keep comming back stronger and stronger to my down to earth development method. I can only say you guys are damned right ! <hr>
<a href="mailto:sven.rieke@gmail.com">Sven Rieke</a>:  (<a href="http://sven.rieke.googlepages.com">http://sven.rieke.googlepages.com</a>) Three years ago I got books about SCRUM and other agile methodologies into my hands.

It was the first time I saw ideas written down that I personally felt necessary and useful for a long time, but never were able to give them a shape.

Since then, I apply these methods and my professional live got much more interesting and eased.<hr>

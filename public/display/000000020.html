<b>Thomas Fihlman</b>:  (Callista IT-Partner) I fully support the four statements<hr>
<a href="mailto:dkmeans@srsconsulting.net">Dan Means</a>:  (<a href="http://www.srsbackofficeteam.com">SRS Consulting, inc.</a>) People always first.<hr>

<b>James Cran</b>: I used to work like the left side, until the process engineers began to take over our IT dept.  The whole point of creating a process to follow is to limit the mistakes of the least productive.  This, then, handcuffs the most productive, because more of their time is now spent creating documents to support the process and inform the micro-managers.  Obviously there is a balance, because zero documentation means zero knowledge capture.  I love the Manifesto, as it attempts to strike that balance - which is all that reasonable developers ever wanted anyway.<hr>
<b>Jens Meiert</b>:  (<a href="http://meiert.com">meiert.com</a>) <hr>
<b>Michael Krumlauf</b>: I wholeheartedly agree with the principles outlined here in the Manifesto.  I believe that these principles show the value of the individual software craftsman.  We are not an indistinguishable group of interchangeable parts, but rather a varied population of developers with individual strengths.  <hr>
<b>Dan Gosche</b>.<hr>
<b>Kim Jung Hyun</b>:  (Contela) Following this manifesto will ensure not only better softwares but also better developers<hr>
<a href="mailto:s.ravindra@vsnl.net">Ravindra. S</a>: As Quality Manager for a reputed IT company, I wish to understand Agile process and implement the same for improving our product quality and customer satisfaction levels. <hr>
<b>Andrew Peters</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:dan@ecodeworks.net">Dan Drechsel</a>:  (<a href="http://eCodeWorks.net">eCodeWorks</a>) The only way to really build software - manage it through people.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bplummer@charter.net">Bill Plummer</a>: For those of us who have been there and recognize a better solution...<hr>

<a href="mailto:creativebizwiz@yahoo.co.uk">Paul Rodriguez</a>:  (freelance, for hire) In the old days we had ssadm (five letters)..now we have 4 (jfdi) ;o) ;o) <hr>
<b>Eric S. Raymond</b>:  (<a href="http://catb.org/~esr">Open Source Initiative</a>) It has become more and more obvious over the
last few years that agile programming and the
Unix/open-source culture are converging.  A 
lot of what you guys are doing sharpens and articulates practices that have been part of
the Unix inheritance for decades.  Some of what you&#39;re doing challenges Unix assumptions
in useful ways.  I&#39;m beginning to think that
I see the outline of a mature, *humane*
discipline of software engineering emerging, and that it will be in large part a blend of
the boldness of the agile movement with the
wesdom and groundedness of the Unix tradition, expressed in open source.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bill.kasper@islandnetworks.co.nz">Bill Kasper</a>:  (<a href="http://www.islandnetworks.co.nz">Island Networks Ltd.</a>) Terse is elegant.<hr>
<a href="mailto:nrsuresh@rediffmail.com">N.R.Suresh</a>:    I , deep from my heart, feel that the Agile Methodology is the best solution for a software development.
   It overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional software development methodlogies.
   And from developer point of view, I like the way it gives importance to the individual rather than the designation.
   I hand my full support to the Agile Methodologies.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:sgolden@qwest.com">Sean Golden</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:public@kered.org">Derek Anderson</a>:  (<a href="http://kered.org">Kered.org</a>) <hr>
<b>Robert Holler</b>:  (<a href="http://www.versionone.net">VersionOne, LLC</a>) <hr>
<b>Chris Danaceau</b>: The simplicity principle especially caught my eye.  I&#39;ve always felt that was essential for producing a robust and maintainable product.<hr>
<a href="mailto:nav@dhunay.com">Nav Dhunay</a>: I fully support the Agile Manifesto.  The whole concept of reducing processes and focusing on communication and interaction is a breath of fresh air.  It&#39;s like going back to the way we originally did software development.<hr>
<a href="mailto:rgacitua@ubiobio.cl">Ricardo Gacitua</a>:  (<a href="http://www.pebu.face.ubiobio.cl/~rgacitua">Universidad del Bio-Bio</a>) I join my opinion to the Agile Manifesto.

From Chile, best regards<hr>
<a href="mailto:npappu@yahoo.com">Nagaraju</a>:  (Independent Consultant) This is Atlas Shrugged in real life!
It is good to see a community of people who think the same thoughts.
Would like to add the following to the manifesto though:
1. The only index of intentions is the actions performed.
2. The only index of performance is the results produced.<hr>
<b>Omair Hamid</b>:  (<a href="http://www.agileagility.com">AgileAgility</a>) I love Kris Read!  He is the man!
He introduced me to Agile Methods and my business, my life, my health have all improved.  What genius.  The way of the 21st century.  <hr>
<b>Angelo Pacifico</b>: Keep it simple as possible.
Agile sound also with pragmatic.
I&#39;m Working with .Net Platform from September 2000. This platform contains all ingredients to be agile in new application devlopment. <hr>
<b>Phil Hsu</b>:  (IMT) <hr>
<a href="mailto:jfortner@solutionsbydesign.tv">Jennifer Fortner</a>: As a certified Project Management Professional, I highly value comprehensive project documentation. However, I firmly believe that a project that does not create true customer satisfaction is a failure. In that respect, I encourage all software developers to ensure that end users are involved in User Acceptance Testing. Far too many companies assume that testing against requirements is enough. Unfortunately, it is often during UAT that customers identify some of their most critical requirements.<hr>
<b>Yannis Rizos</b>: Go Agile!<hr>
<b>Ludovic Hoarau</b>: According to me, Agile Manifesto is within every developer. Agile is the way to express it.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mdhall@sta.samsung.com">Mike Hall</a>:  (Samsung) I believe that the Agile approach is by far the most appropriate software paradigm for a future filled with increasingly complex applications and dynamic business models. Samsung Telecommunications America will strive to continue using agile methods in our R&amp;D efforts.<hr>

<b>Shawn Ali</b>.<hr>
<b>Diego Gil</b>:  (Admin S.A.) <hr>
<a href="mailto:maurizio.sapienza@telecomitalia.it">Maurizio Sapienza</a>: The real thing is how to prevent people to hide their weakness behind too formalized processes and documents es well as informal relationship and lack of responsability.<hr>
<a href="mailto:Gary.Ardito@novell.com">Gary Ardito</a>:  (<a href="http://www.Novell.com">Novell</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:kaner@kaner.com">Cem Kaner</a>:  (<a href="http://www.testingeducation.org">Florida Tech</a>) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:donnal@donnal.net">Donnal Walter, MD</a>:  (<a href="http://mindwrapper.org">UAMS and Arkansas Children's Hospital</a>) As a practicing clinician, nearly every day I see ways that computer technology could be used to improve the healthcare that my colleagues and I provide, or make rendering that care easier, or both. Rarely, however, does existing software meet the needs of the specific situation. Thus I have long wished for the capability to develop custom clinical applications that are effective, reliable, maintainable, and of course timely.

The word I have often used to describe the custom (clinical) software development process is evolution. &quot;Evolutionary software&quot; is adaptive, responding to change rather than following a strict plan, evolving through incremental improvements, one step at a time. This approach values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, collaboration over ownership. And these principles happen to be those promoted by the Manifesto.<hr>
<b>Babis Marmanis</b>:  (<a href="http://www.marmanis.com/">http://www.marmanis.com/</a>) The Agile movement is the natural reaction to a formalistic perspective of developing software. It resembles the difference between pure mathematics versus applied or engineering mathematics. Hundreds of years of experience in mathematical sciences shows that, although there is merit in strict formalism, significant progress comes from a more &quot;agile&quot; attitude towards the use of mathematics. Dirac&#39;s delta would have been 
postponed for decades had the physicists waited the formalists to sort things out. 

When formalism and processes overwhelm the development team, efficiency is reduced, innovation almost disappears, customer competitive advantage evaporates, and customer
satisfaction transforms into customer aggravation. 

The mere existence and acknowledgement of the Agile Manifesto brings a counter-weight that balances the current perspective that dominates our industry today.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ashutosh@reach1to1.com">Ashutosh Bijoor</a>:  (<a href="http://www.reach1to1.com">Reach1to1 Communications</a>) Agile software development benefits are manifold. We have practised agile development methodologies for several years, and for every single project and product developed by us.

Reach1to1 Communications delivers results - consistently, thanks to its agile development awareness.

We hereby sign the Agile Software Development Manifesto as an earnest call to developers and users to use and demand agile methods.<hr>

<a href="mailto:chirag_gandhi@eudoramail.com">Chirag Gandhi</a>:  (<a href="http://www.apar.com">Apar Infotech</a>) Agile Manifesto is the key to success and satisfaction in every business. <hr>
<a href="mailto:paul.umbers@bigfoot.com">Paul Umbers</a>: I&#39;ve always valued simplicity and flexibility in the software development process and I think the Agile Manifesto summarises those concepts for me. <hr>
<a href="mailto:milanpop@yubc.net">Milan Popovic</a>: I am a Univeristy professor in CS, and I am glad to see new ideas for better sw development.<hr>
<a href="mailto:csharpener@softhome.net">John Tobler</a>:  (<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jtobler/">http://weblogs.asp.net/jtobler/</a>) I have experienced the full range from no &quot;methodology&quot; to far too much.  From moment to moment, I seek the proper balance point along the dynamic continuum.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:jgoodsen@radsoft.com">John Goodsen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.radsoft.com">RADSoft</a>) Agile is our middle name - wait, we don&#39;t have a middle name!<hr>

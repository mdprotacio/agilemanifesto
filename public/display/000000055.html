<b>Alex Laburu</b>:  (<a href="http://laburu.org/~alex/rants/lsd-meta">The LSD-Meth User's Guide</a>) I hereby endorse the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bhouse@apolloenterprise.com">Bill House</a>:  (<a href="http://apolloenterprise.com">Apollo Enterprise Solutions</a>) Having been an advocate of lightweight development methodologies for many years, it&#39;s good to see the emergence of Agile. Now, rather than dealing with heavy processes that are obstacles to be overcome, we can embrace a process methodology that actually helps us create great software! At last, we have something in the software biz that actually deserves its exclamation points! :-)<hr>
<a href="mailto:Ephaeton@gmx.net">Martin S. Weber</a>:  (Many :)) I agree; especially to #1. This has to be repeated because it&#39;s so important.

INDIVIDUALS are more worthy than processes!!!<hr>
<a href="mailto:rick.bourner@gmail.com">Richard Bourner</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ubs.com">UBS</a>) Requirements solidify as a project proceeds.  We must accommodate change, within budgetary constraints, in order that we deliver customer satisfaction and high quality systems.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bibhas_chatterjee@yahoo.com">Bibhas Chatterjee</a>:  (<a href="http://www.siemens.com">Siemens</a>) This software process orientation will be helpful for all the participants who are involved into the software development process. I wish this will create a new environment where all the participants will be happy as they are valued and they can deliver a product which will be valued.
Thanks to all.<hr>
<a href="mailto:rawitat@cp.su.ac.th">Rawitat Pulam</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cs.su.ac.th/~rawitat">Department of Computing, Silpakorn University</a>) Coming from the Complex Adaptive System (in short, Complex System Theory) studies, I can see its value immediately in application to Software Development. Simple set of rules, interacting individual agents, flowing information ... and then the self-organized, emergence, adaptive patterns as the result.

It&#39;s dead simple, flexible, adn as-it-should-be.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mmagaldi@directtalk.com.br">Mauricio Magaldi</a>:  (<a href="http://www.directtalk.com.br">Direct Talk</a>) We were trying to implement our own version of the PMI where we ran into the Agile Manifesto on Google.
It is soon to be the guideline to our project methodology.<hr>
<b>Rana Kundu</b>: I cannot think of any other set of values and principles in software development, that I feel this strongly about. I have long been an advocate for &quot;intent based&quot; processes, but have always felt challenged in trying to present a coherent set of values. The elegance of this manifesto is overwhelming. I feel honoured to be a part of this wave.<hr>

Doesn&#39;t matter how vast your organisation is or how great you are technically, if not agile in software, there is no survival in this custom software development business.
When I came to this site a while ago, the concepts looked utopian at first glance. To me now they are hardcore reality.<hr>
<b>Mark Wusinich</b>:  (Bank of America) &#39;It is better to light a single candle, than to curse the darkness&#39;, however you guys are putting a flood light on the subject. Thanks and keep it up.<hr>
<a href="mailto:m.jankowski@teta.com.pl">Maciej Jankowski</a>:  (TETA S.A.) I agree witch all values that contains manifesto.
Doing software in this way is easier for developer and more valuable for customer.<hr>
<a href="mailto:joel@speednet.com">Joel Anderson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.speednet.com">SpeedNet Services, Inc</a>) The Agile Manifesto represents the best embodiment of entrepeneureal, small-team software delivery available today. Coupled with  a focus on the capabilities of properly motivated people, the Agile methodology can and does prove to be a competitive alternative to heavyweight processes.<hr>
<a href="mailto:purush_manickam@yahoo.com">Purush Manickam</a>: I fully support Agile method of project management.<hr>

<b>Bryan Hunter</b>: I&#39;ve been a software developer for almost 14 years now.  In that time I&#39;ve been involved in a lot of failed projects.  Projects that took entirely too long to deliver value to the customer.  Projects that produced reams and reams of requirement and design documentation that no one ever read once produced.
I&#39;ve been involved in an Agile project for over a year now and I can honestly say that I wouldn&#39;t want to go back to the &#39;good old days&#39; of waterfall methodology.
Agile is not a silver bullet - it will not solve all your problems - it will, however, allow you to find your problems earlier and adapt.<hr>
<a href="mailto:cliff@capcomms.net">Cliff Pearson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.capcomms.net">CAP Communications</a>) Without realising that the manifesto exists, I&#39;ve been employing it&#39;s principles for many years now.  

Engaging the client and keeping things simple are key ideals for me.

Long live the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<a href="mailto:barrie.callender@btinternet.com">Barrie Callender</a>:  (Pinnacle Management Systems) As a project management practicioner, I have been excited by the Agile movement and believe the elements and philosophy can be applied to a number of disciplines apart from just software development.  
I should have signed up years ago!<hr>
<b>Jim Taliadoros</b>:  (<a href="http://www.taliadoros.co.uk">Cantons Consultants Ltd</a>) I strongly support agile development methods. Practices that lead to development processes that allow the client to react to market needs are imperative to the success of a project.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:stevenalt01@aol.com">Steven Alt </a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ronnie.morris@eglin.af.mil">Ronnie A Morris</a>:  (53CSS/SCC USAF) Thanks for allowing me to be part of this effort.  The Agile Manifesto elaborates what I&#39;ve been feeling and thinking for years.  Thanks!<hr>
<a href="mailto:doug.fleming@verizon.net">Doug Fleming</a>: I have managed many projects and have always worked to bring the business and technology groups together to ensure a clear and concise understanding of the requirements.  The Agile methodology as stated seems to be a common sense approach to bridging the gap between technology and business for N-Tiered development.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:gresham@mediavisual.com">Paul Gresham</a>:  (Paul Gresham Engineering Ltd) Having now managed (always hands-on) various projects, from small financial applications where developers have extremely focussed business knowledge, right through to six sigma telecoms projects with over 100 staff, I fully support following the agile manifesto.

For me, following an agile approach has been particularly important when delivering software with teams that are distrubuted around the world.

Go agile, deliver stuff!<hr>

<a href="mailto:cam.wolff@gmail.com">Cameron Wolff</a>:  (<a href="http://www.camwolff.com">http://www.camwolff.com</a>) Agile methods continue to work well for me and my business partners.

<a href="mailto:nitin-sharma@india.com">Nitin Sharma</a>: Hi,
I came across ASCI and was profoundly impressed with its directive principles and guiding vision.
Hence,would be delighted to a be a part of this beacon of light for Software-IT vertical in the country.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kmpetty@computer.org">Kenneth Petty</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:fwklucznik@mchsi.com">Frank W. Klucznik</a>:  (U.S. Government) I&#39;v been using Agile Development methods for two years now, and didn&#39;t even know it had a name. I just applied principles of Quality Management to software development and developed a similar process.  

I just spent the past 24 months developing and deploying a 12 month software project b/c of the 300+ pages of documentation required for system approval. However, b/c of agile processes, application development is running 8-12 months ahead of the documentation and actually driving the approval process.  This is not popular among my contempories, but I have set an organizational record for bringing an enterprise wide system from concept to full deployment. That accomplishment has done more for the end-users and organization than any amount of documentation can.

I am fully on board w/ Agile Software Development b/c I arrived at the same conclusions through a separate path.<hr>

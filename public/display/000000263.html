<b>Mario D'Andre Robinson</b>:  (<a href="http://www.8robinsons.com">8 Robinsons LLC</a>) In the fast paced environments I currently work in, this method is by far the best solution. It&#39;s flexible, and light enough to change when its least expected as our customers and technology continue to change and adapt even during the course of a project.<hr>

I fully support the Agile Manifesto.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ersin.taskin@kod-a.com">Ersin TASKIN</a>:  (<a href="http://www.kod-a.com">Kod-A</a>) I believe this manifesto reflects the most natural software development approach.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ceo@hometownreflections.com">Robert E Smith</a>:  (<a href="http://www.hometownreflections.com">Hometown Reflections</a>) Using the viewpoint that Customer collaboration is far more productive over contract negotiation will ever be we are allowed to move forward with every project at a much faster and smoother pace. By responding to the inevitable changes that occur over following a plan that was conceived with the very best of intentions we are able to adapt and progress toward the positive conclusion that every stake holder desires.<hr>
<b>Brian Davies</b>:  (<a href="http://prac.com">Plymouth Rock</a>) The application of the princples stated in the manifesto have led to great advances in the way software development processes are coordinated and implemented. My views are founded from personal experience working on projects were they been adopted.<hr>

Having just finished a major cycle of bootstrapping a software vision into existence as a working HTML 5.5 prototype of smart textbooks for children using Maqetta, I realized the most important active ingredient was still missing -- the CUSTOMER COLLABORATION of teachers (and children) from the ground up. Fortunately, whatever Angel is governing these affairs was kind enough to cover my rear and let me get this far with a growing, but still passive, base of customer supporters. Then discovery-of-Agile time, which is where we are now. I see lots of work still ahead (i.e., more iterations), but then nobody said it would be easy! Thanks so much for existing.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tony@criticalclouds.com">Anthony McDermott</a>:  (Critical Clouds Corp) In today&#39;s mission oriented world the ability to change approach and rapidly modify tools is essential if one is to survive.

The agile manifesto is the next phase of maturity in code development.  Its responsible!<hr>
<b>Shamim Ahmad Khan</b>:  (Ericsson AB) <hr>
<b>Anne L Coulombe, MBA Tech Eng, PMP</b>: Should have signed the manifesto nearly a decade ago :-) Agile is really the only way to compete in today&#39;s fast changing multi-layer competitive tech world.<hr>
<b>Tomasz Czubkowski</b>:  (<a href="http://www.contman.pl">CONTMAN Sp. z o.o.</a>) I fully support The Manifesto for Agile Software Development. I really beleive in the balanced development where individuals, funcionalities, customers involved and quick response to changes play with processes, tools, contracts. Traditional development cannot possibly adapt quickly enough for competitive advantage, and when complete, is already outdated. Constant communication and response is key to maintaining viable solutions for businesses. I have witnessed Agile and adaptive teams deliver projects that more completely satisfy and delight the customer, simply because the customer saw progress, which allowed them to continue supporting the development.<hr>

As a technology specialist i am always seeking new approaches to software development and management that guarantee hyper-productivity, zero bug software and high customer satisfaction.

Agile processes and practices, especially Scrum adn XP, have been my guideline these years to constant personal and professional improvement.<hr>
<b>Joel Dubiner</b>: It&#39;s all about creating great software and being open to continual improvements in tools and techniques.  I&#39;m proud to be a part of the Agile community in SLC and beyond.<hr>
<b>Barry Pearl</b>.<hr>
<b>Steve Miskiewicz</b>: I&#39;ve seen Agile Practices break down the walls between the business, developers and testers.    Everyone works together to build great software.  We make it easy to build, deploy, and test software. We deliver software quickly.  I could go on and on...  Why did it take me so long to sign this???<hr>

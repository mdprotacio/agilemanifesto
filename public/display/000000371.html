<a href="mailto:CornerstoneInc@gmail.com">Michael Barron</a>: I fully support the Agile Manifesto!  Throughout my career I always felt there must be a better way to deliver projects. While I learn the Agile methodology I feel my focus can shift to delivering quality products not spending all my time on process and procedures, focus more on delivering results vs spending all day in meetings. Agile feels so natural!  <hr>

I fully endorse the Agile Manifesto, as I cannot think of any other approach of delivering working software, which is adaptive and responsive to change, whilst reducing risk and proving the business value early in a project. Many congratulations to pioneers and visionaries like Martin, who saw the value of such approach since 2001.<hr>

<a href="mailto:amitsrivastava.dei@gmail.com">Amit Kumar Srivastava</a>:  (HCL Technologies) I have been working as agile evangelist, helping different projects at HCL Technologies, to transition to Agile way of working.

Couple of years back, I managed a project following iterative methodology which was a success story.  After I started working in Agile, I realized that unknowingly I was primarily doing all the things adhering to Agile Manifesto and that&#39;s the reason it was successful. We delivered 100% of what customer was expecting, though it was just 70% of the requirements that client gave in the start.<hr>

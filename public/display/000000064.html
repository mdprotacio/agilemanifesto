<a href="mailto:yuri_vrancken@yahoo.com">Yuri Vrancken</a>:  (<a href="http://www.qnh.nl">QNH</a>) Development is done by humans. Software is written by humans. Humans like an easy way of living and working. This way of working clears all the fog around the Software Development process. People who are afraid of this approach simply aren&#39;t human.<hr>

<b>Bob Tabbiner</b>:  (BayRidge Solutions) To my surprise, someone had documented my beliefs in software and architecture development.  The most successful teams I have been part of have lived the principles of Agile Software Development for years prior to it&#39;s formalization. I called it taking a pragmatic approach to meeting customer needs.  Now I&#39;ll call it the Agile approach!<hr>
<b>Arval Headrick</b>.<hr>
<b>Carlos M. Recalde</b>:  (<a href="http://www.successfultechnology.com">Successful Technology, LLC</a>) I&#39;ve taken too long to sign this agreement (but that&#39;s mostly because I was stuck in a Dilbertesque organization for most of the last few years.)  Now I have no excuse.  

I&#39;ll be asking all of my development partners to at least review this site. I know where to find new enlightened partners if any of the existing ones don&#39;t feel comfortable with this Manifesto.

Keep on changin&#39;<hr>
<a href="mailto:bern4d@gmail.com">Bernad Pakpahan</a>:  (<a href="http://blogs.netindonesia.net/bernardpakpahan">PT Netway Utama</a>) I&#39;m very intereset with this manifesto. I glad to recieve more information from this community<hr>

<a href="mailto:otigli@gmail.com">Ogun TIGLI</a>: Today, the software requirements are moving targets, everything is dramatically changing and yes, they are changing so fast. Expectations are quite high. I believe the Agile process is one of the important cornerstone in software development that can help us with these on going challenges in the software development process.<hr>

<b>David Cancel</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:vondino@gmail.com">Vinod Kumar Dorairaj</a>:  (<a href="http://www.vcustomer.com">Vcustomer technologies</a>) Agile software development is where software development started from, we must accept that. 

Plainly because of the fact that everything that starts starts simple and gets complicated due to hte growing demands of diverse groups.

It has today given birth to intensive software development practices, the cmm, itrix, iso etc and surprisingly is being treated as a new comer, which is sad, not bad though.

When we want the best we must get it from several worlds, why worlds, even universes. 

Good wishes to all the people in all their drives to make software development great.<hr>
<a href="mailto:rohit.bhat@kewill.com">Rohit Ravi Bhat</a>: Change is the only Constant in the world. So it is better we accept the reality and act in time to adapt to the change .
Time to Market is what makes a company different from others so i think time has come for the Agile development to become a standard in the industry.<hr>

<b>Mohammed Qattan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.mqattan.com">http://www.mqattan.com</a>) Allow me to share with you the true story about user stories.

Warning, User Stories are nothing but addiction. once you get used to them , everything in your life is just another user story.

clients just LOVE it when you take notes.
they also ask you to write things down.

i used to do it  on a laptop, instantly, and agian the customer had doubts that i did.

but now I go to the client with User Stories.
another note and another user story.

Use Cases are a waste of time for the developer.
and it takes 5 minutes to do something that you can just do in less than a minute.

User Story .....
this is my story with the user story<hr>
<a href="mailto:coling@macmicro.com">Colin Goldberg</a>:  (<a href="http://www.macmicro.com">MacMicro Inc</a>) Since the growth of complexity in software development (when did that begin?), Agile Development, under its various names (Spiral Methodology, Rapid Application development,...) is the most effective (and only) way to provide solutions these days. Having subscribed to these ideals for many years, I was pleasantly surprised to come across this site.<hr>
<b>Alexandro Dias de Almeida</b>.<hr>
<b>Lucas Rodriguez Cervera</b>:  (<a href="http://www.nevant.com">Nevant - The process documentation company</a>) Trying this approach for the first time...<hr>
<b>Jonathan Lindsay</b>: The principles are so obviously correct and no one would try and argue with them. However, getting management to sign up to this new paradigm and change their dictorial habits is exremely difficult. Perhaps i should just take Max Plancks advice and simply wait. <hr>

Thanks to all for making it esthetically and linguistically clear.<hr>

<b>Tyler Black</b>:  (<a href="http://www.pixpo.com">PiXPO Inc.</a>) Consumers rule the world.  If one cannot respond to the changing needs of the consumer, that person will be left behind.  We do not create software for process, we create software for people.  I&#39;m proud to be a part of the Agile Proletariat, and thank you for creating this manifesto.<hr>

<a href="mailto:greg@greghutchings.com">Greg Hutchings</a>: The Agile Manifesto acknowledges the criticality of people, results, collaboration and adaptation in our work in software development, and I am glad to be a signer and an Agile practioner.  Thanks to Gregor Hohpe, Matt Short, Martin Fowler, David Rice, Robin Gibson, Aman Bhutani, Merhdad Rashidfarruki, Tom Looy, Craig Larman and many other practicing agile developers and team leaders who I have learned from at ThoughtWorks, Valtech and independently.  <hr>

<b>Viswanathan Subbarayan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.posdec.com">Posdec Technologies</a>) Iterative or Agile development is a way to get a working software. It gets us the key problems at early stage than developing everything over months and stuck on the problem when integration starts.

Now loads of companies are trying to get into agile methodology stands as vindication for the process itself.<hr>

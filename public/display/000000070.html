<b>Colm Smyth</b>:  (<a href="http://colmsmyth.blogspot.com">http://colmsmyth.blogspot.com</a>) Agile principles simply make sense, provided they are balanced with appropriate levels of design and pragmatic documentation to support the project scale, risk and technical difficulty.<hr>
<a href="mailto:legoke@ananzi.co.za">Alpheus Mokgalaka</a>:  (UP) I welcome change even in social development environment,I do!<hr>
<a href="mailto:kyatsenko@mail.ru">Kirill Yatsenko</a>:  (<a href="http://www.uktbgroup.com">United KTB Group</a>) People over tools, not vice versa!<hr>
<a href="mailto:jvega@my-xml.com">José Vega</a>:  (<a href="http://www.my-xml.com">my-xML</a>) I subscribe to the Agile Manifesto because we have found it is a very interesting approach for developing software projects. We are currently analyzing the Agile Modeling (AM) in the framework of our activity…<hr>
<a href="mailto:biffo@tiscali.it">Andrea Tagliabue</a>:  (<a href="http://www.wikibit.it">wikibit.it</a>) I&#39;m both software developer and software customer. As a customer I&#39;m fed up to spend hours  to validate tons of documentation and every time you change even a comma re-validate, and when they put the software in the preprod environment re-re-validate, and if you have to change a label in the sw you have to wait months and spend ten times the time in checking  documentation than the time they need to change the code (as well as money). And now has arrived also SOA  to make things worse. As a sw  developer I don&#39;t want to oppress a customer in this way. I comprehend them if they prefer to continue to use paper and pen.<hr>
<b>Charles H Irwin</b>:  (Boeing) <hr>
<a href="mailto:sherri.pennington@pgworks.com">Sherri P. Pennington</a>: I whole-heartedly agree with the manifesto.  Most of my recent projects have been fast paced and in need of this methodology.  The collaborative efforts of the businss, vendor and IS from the very beginning and throughout the poject has been pleasing to all. <hr>
<b>Ram R. Kumar</b>:  (BellSouth Telecommunications) As a software developer and a manager, I strongly believe and subscribe to Agile Manifesto. We are currently transitioning from traditional waterfall model to Agile based development. I am truly excited and looking forward to highly collaborative software development teams than the current process heavy methods.<hr>

Great!!<td width="233"><b>Venkat Srikumar</b>: If you have ever worked on a project that took more than an year to finish and had the company fold because it was too late to market with the software you will appreciate how carried away people can get about processes over real business needs<hr>

<a href="mailto:michaeldomino@excite.com">Michael Domino</a>: I have been quite naturally practicing the Agile Manifesto values throughout my entire career in software development. It&#39;s nice to be vindicated after resisting bureaucratic overplanning and reporting for so long as a lonely voice in the wilderness. Now, I can hit people over the head with an authentic Manifesto! Thanks.<hr>

<b>Justin Ryan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.gnudyne.com/">Gnudyne</a>) I&#39;ve been excited about Agile development for a long time, and use this methodology as part of my sales approach for Agile tools.  Within a year of my first job as a developer, I played a crucial role in converting us to an Agile methodology and increasing the amount of changes we were able to implement by an order of magnitude.<hr>

I really believe success will be more likely.<hr>

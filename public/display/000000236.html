Thanks.<hr>

<b>Silvio Knizek</b>.<hr>
<b>Zenicolon</b>:  (<a href="http://zenicolon.blogspot.com/">Zenicolon</a>) I personally think every software developer has a natural desire to develop software in an agile way and so we all should support the Agile Manifesto.<hr>
<b>Aki Ristkari</b>: For me agile is the way to go. Goal worthy of pursuing. While there are other ways of doing software development I firmly believe that agile is the best way to go.<hr>
<b>Michael G Levey</b>: The agile philosophy is one of the more sensible and aggressive methodologies that I have had the pleasure to work with for several years. I have practiced this methodology in many development projects before I remember seeing it actually labelled &quot;Agile&quot;. I love it!!<hr>
<b>Martin Naskovski</b>: Agile is the way to go! It works and is sufficiently flexible to adjust to moving targets such as ever-changing requirements - a common occurrence in today&#39;s fast-paced business culture. It also brings teams closer, creates team cohesion and reinforces a go-getting culture in any enterprise. Agile places the attention on getting a working product out the door first, without neglecting process, documentation, negotiations or planning. It merely de-emphasizes these values as the make-it-or-break-it criteria for any enterprise, large or small until a product is created by emphasizing what matters - people, a working product, taking care of #1 - the customer, and ensures a transformative culture rather than one stuck on &#39;religious practices.&#39;<hr>
<b>Anthony Potamitis</b>:  (<a href="http://www.agilecyprus.com">http://www.agilecyprus.com</a>) support the manifesto. be agile and do not let labels get in the way of helping to make development fun and robust.<hr>
<b>Azar Ali Zain</b>: After having worked for 4 years in Software Development, and after my current 1 year experience in a big multinational petrochemical industry&#39;s Software Development department, the Agile practices are what I have found to be the most suiting ones.

When we work in an enterprise, we are not just looking at a classic piece of artwork to deliver, the point is to deliver what the client needs, for which the Agile Manifesto works adequately.<hr>

<b>Özgü Soyukibar</b>: I am a Computer Engineering student and I am learning UP methodology and quite enthusiastic about it. So here is my support for Agile Manifesto. <hr>
<b>Sat Kelley </b>:  (<a href="http://www.heathdental.com">Heath Dental</a>) I fully support the agile manifesto.<hr>
<a href="mailto:william.j.falconer@gmail.com">William Falconer</a>: Having used this in a couple of places over the last few years, I think its good to have these principles as a starting point - it is more important to understand and apply the general principle than endorse a specific methodology. 

This is because not all development teams have the same needs. I think its a good way to go as it helps to adapt to the changing needs of customers and businesses better.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mike@colomtns.com">Mike Smith</a>:  (Colorado Mountain Outfitters, LLC) The beauty of Agile Development is that it embodies the natural flow of product development by innovative individuals working on concert with common goals.  The rapid deployment of product, whether it is physical or software related, is very similar and requires constant adjustment and rapid response to needs.  If Product/Project development were characterized as a philosophy, Agile is the successful blending of Zen and Accomplishment, two normally exclusive treatise.  Agile is the perfect weapon against the rigid management style of traditional waterfall methods.<hr>

<b>Oleg Larionov</b>.<hr>
<b>Jon Hoffman</b>:  (<a href="http://www.insanelycrazy.net">http://www.insanelycrazy.net</a>) If you keep these principles in mind and develop your team with them, then you will be successful. <hr>

<b>Stephanie Stewart</b>: Embrace it and never turn back!<hr>
<a href="mailto:themjnunez@gmail.com">Mauricio Javier Núñez Jiménez</a>.<hr>
<b>William Miceli</b>: I look forward to the day when people with vested interests that compete or interfere with these values and goals are openly ridiculed and vetted from involvement.<hr>
<b>HD Nguyen</b>: Agile has revolutionized the software development industry and is continue to transform industries of where any kind of product development is taking place. 

I believe that those who do not adopt an Agile methodology will not be able to stay competitive in an ever-evolving space where the pace of production and innovation continues accelerating.

I support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<b>Michael Huffman</b>:  (Rapid7) <hr>
<b>jorge campal</b>: I totally agree with the manifesto<td width="233"><a href="mailto:mail@bitcrumbtrail.com">Mike Eskenazi</a>:  (<a href="http://www.bitcrumbtrail.com">http://www.bitcrumbtrail.com</a>) The &quot;Agile&quot; way to produce results for clients puts trust back into the partnership.  The client gets the opportunity to build an application incrementally, and the developer learns how to refine the application sooner rather than later.  Signing the Agile Manifesto requires a bold commitment to achieve these goals.  Agile programmers delivering code must be ready to move quickly. They benefit from preparation including extensive, flexible, interconnected code libraries and thorough testing.  This lets the developer focus on the client&#39;s needs and the project goal.<hr>

I look forward to exploring further how it&#39;s attributes and principles can benefit global-focussed software development.<hr>
<b>Sonia Bravo</b>:  (Metro de Madrid) <hr>
<b>Adam Wiebe</b>:  (<a href="http://www.appirio.com">Appirio</a>) Great to see that over a decade later the concepts are as relevant as ever.  Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose....according to Dan Pink these are what drive intrinsic motivation and they seem to be exactly what drives ASD.   Solid!<hr>

This is the true meaning of responding to change...

<b>Sanjay Raghavan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.louisiana.edu/">Masters Student</a>) It&#39;s exciting.
A focus on people is a catalyst for new ideas.<hr>
<a href="mailto:haohaijing@263.net">Jane Hao</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:info@deicon.de">Dieter Eickstaedt</a>:  (<a href="http://www.deicon.de">deiCon Softwareservice GmbH</a>) As an Open Source Evangelist, I strongly support the manifest as the basis for good and professional Free Software Projects. <hr>
<a href="mailto:stefans@amdocs.com">Stefan Schuerger</a>:  (AMDOCS Germany) This is a &quot;back to business&quot; approach, very much agreeable. I&#39;ve seen too many cases of over-regulation, where one couldn&#39;t see the woods for all the trees... With reduced procedure overhead, we can provide more value for our customers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:haohaijing@263.net">Jane Hao</a>: I am a Chinese software engineer and my concerntration area was CMM in my graduate study. I am quite interest in Agile and support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<a href="mailto:edgar.sanchez@objeq.com">Edgar Sánchez</a>:  (<a href="http://www.objeq.com">Objeq</a>) We develop software in Ecuador, Southamerica. In cash-constrained environments like Latin American countries it becomes even more important to deliver as early as possible working software. Not to talk about the constant turmoil in the region, change down here more than a constant is almost a disease. Thus, I deeply feel that for countries like mine the principles of the Agile Manifesto more than a good option are question of survival.<hr>
<b>Ann Godfrey</b>:  (<a href="http://www.suncorp.com.au">Suncorp</a>) I am a relative newcomer to Agile, developing and implementing the process into a banking environment whose general community are totally indoctrinated in &#39;heavy&#39; process, methodologies and documentation.  It&#39;s been an interesting year, but I am convinced that this is a valuable and practicable model for them - particularly in light of the trends toward Web developing for banking/finance.<hr>
<a href="mailto:manoj@eversunsoft.com">Manoj Khanna</a>:  (<a href="http://eversunsoft.com">Eversun Software Corporation</a>) We have been practicing agile methodologies for a couple of years now. And we have been able to produce best results, were able to deliver on time and cut our costs and resources too. 

We believe that agile methods are the way to success, and they fulfill the stringent requirements of a large to mid-scale level software projects. Without it a manager would be handicap as they have been for many years now. Its time for a change, its time to be agile.<hr>
<a href="mailto:volker.brandt@web.de">Volker Brandt</a>:  (<a href="http://www.develop-group.de">develop group</a>) I really appreciate the publication of the agile manifest. It should be learned by heart and followed by all developers and project managers out there.<hr>
<a href="mailto:martin_a_leclerc@yahoo.com">Martin Leclerc</a>: I have tried it. Never seen such happy customers :-)<hr>
<b>Robert McMichael</b>: Done right, with true commitment to these ideals, the results are a beautiful thing to behold.  Done in half measures, a tragedy of what might have been. <hr>
<b>George V. Woodrow III</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jbo@neurosoft.net">Jaroslaw Borelowski</a>:  (NEUROSOFT) <td width="233"><b>Ali Kousari</b>:  (Algotech SA) I am supporting Agile. Tired of being inneficient and listening to the managerial bullshit (excuse the language but this is not a technical paper).

Plz standby

<a href="mailto:bwoods@nolacom.com">Bruce Woods</a>:  (<a href="http://www.nolacom.com">NOLA Computer Services</a>) We have been using Agile methods, specifically XP, since January 2000. The way software evolves in an agile development is natural. Our customers benefit from seeing, touching and using the software earlier in the development process than a typical waterfall development. Also, our customers appreciate receiving a new release of software much more than a document indicating what software they may or may not receive in the future.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jerry_smetzer@fishgame.state.ak.us">Jerry Smetzer</a>:  (<a href="http://www.state.ak.us/adfg/adfghome.htm">State of Alaska - Department of Fish and Game</a>) I&#39;m very interested in your user-oriented approach to building apps, and am trying to apply the major features of it to our new projects.<hr>
<a href="mailto:freesty101@aol.com">Mike Kenworthy</a>: Please convey this to the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.  They are operating in the dark, very dark ages, and their client, the US Government, is suffering because of this.  <hr>
<b>Antony Grinyer</b>: Being a software developer in the industry I am at constant exposure to the many problems associated with the development lifecycle. In my opinion the agile manifesto is the most exciting and &#39;realistic&#39; way forward for software development...I&#39;m looking forward to adopting this methodology in my practises.<hr>

<b>Paul Reynolds</b>.<hr>
<b>Ranjiva Prasad</b>: Superb development methodology. Getting a lot of deserved recognition in my organisation. <hr>
<a href="mailto:jkunecke@prodigy.net">John A. Kunecke</a>:  (<a href="http://browse.to/jakresume">self</a>) I have utilized the principals of the Agile Manifesto in my work for years (~15), only a few of my peers and fewer of my mangement have appreciated it.

Please note the award from my supervisor (http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/portal/135/SubPages/RecogBoeIDEF.htm) regarding the results of a process I developed.<hr>
<a href="mailto:fstewart@erols.com">fred stewart</a>:  (BAE Systems/Enterprise Systems Inc.) I strongly concur with the principle focus on persons and collaboration (i.e, individuals and interaction) vs. processes and tools, with the follwing caveats:

1) coherent processes subordinated to facilitating collective productivity are indispensable to effective collaboration;

2)tools subordinated to facilitating collaboration-friendly processes are almost indispensable to effective collaboration.

I also see this principle as having a broader application than software development - e.g., agile approaches to process improvement (which of course should mean improved facilitation of collaboration!).<hr>

<a href="mailto:mac@macnjac.net">John McEntire</a>:  (McEntire and Associates) <td width="233"><b>Bo Carlsson</b>:  (Posten Sverige AB) Throughout my years as software developer I&#39;ve found that individual motivation and responsibility among all project members are the main factors behind a successful project.
With close customer collaboration we become a team focusing all energy on fighting risks instead of each other.<hr>
<a href="mailto:pal-kristian.levang@telenor.com">Paal Kristian Levang</a>:  (<a href="http://www.djuice.com">Common Technology, Telenor mobil</a>) Agile Development is a must if your wants to do alteration work on an internet system.<hr>
<a href="mailto:martijn@believe-it.nl">Martijn Elzinga</a>:  (<a href="http://www.believe-it.nl/index.php?lang=en&file=index.xml">believe IT consulting</a>) We believe that IT works... Signing The Agile Manifesto is a statement not only for ourself but also towards the industry that &quot;we&quot; have a responsibility towards our clients ... to do things the agile way..<hr>
<b> Ionel Munoz</b>: &quot;Responding to change over following a plan&quot;. I love that part of The Manifesto. It doesn&#39;t exclude having a well-defined strategy. &quot;Responding to change&quot; is about tactics, and still a strategy in itself.<hr>
<a href="mailto:patbly@attbi.com">Patrick M. Bailey</a>:  (Grand Valley Statue University) After 20 years, getting the job done boils down to this: motivated people who are trained.<hr>
<b>David Butt</b>:  (Project Manager) I have worked with and studied agile systems development for 4 years. My experience has taught me that this approach is clearly the best when it comes to delivering systems and business change.

Through the British Computer Society, I hope to establish a UK centre of competence forum, open to all interested parties; to exchange ideas and raise the awareness/ understanding of ASD across the UK.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tour_ren@hotmail.com">Tort Ren</a>: I think the good design is also important and valued.
Here, &quot;good&quot; design means fewer effort cost than the &quot;bad&quot; one while the change happen.<hr>

I have 24 years of software development, that is why I know when I tell all of you, that you are focusing on the right issues of software development!!!<hr>
<a href="mailto:harrda@idx.com.au">David Harris</a>:  (EDS) Having worked as a poject manager for many years I have come to see the short comings of
project effort necessarily falling into lockstep with rigid
methodologies that are normally enforced by 
host organisations. I totally support standards, especially
easily measured standards but am too often frustrated in
my effort to satisfy client needs by needing
to adhere to orthodoxy to the detriment of
client satisfaction.<hr>

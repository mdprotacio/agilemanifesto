<b>barbara M avakian</b>: i must confess agile is a more efficient process that provides solid products.  project managers accustomed to heavy documentation, although still important to certain organizations, can learn a lot from the agile methodology to create a leaner process in a fast-paced, global competitive economy and landscape in web development.<hr>

<a href="mailto:leonardi.marcello@gmail.com">Marcello Leonardi</a>: I was introduced into agile software development in 2006. At this time I was a software engineer. Scrum was introduced in my project and I feel the transformation from the first days. The values of the agile manifesto are for me the centrals values which I will follow in my current and future project. Now that I changed from development to the project leaders role I&#39;m sure that I can help some customers and teams to implement successfully software projects, if they are ready to accept commitments, to be open minded, to focus on the vision and major project goals, to respect each other and to have the courage to break rules which does not works since years.<hr>

<a href="mailto:hartger.visser@gmail.com">Hartger Visser</a>:  (<a href="http://www.teuker.nl">Teuker Small  Business Solutions</a>) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:chirag.m.shinde@gmail.com">Chirag Shinde</a>: I had a research background, I have been working as a software engineer for 13 years. While you don&#39;t have &quot;customer collaboration&quot; in research, good research comes from exploration which in some sense is &quot;responding to change&quot;. When doing research you have to contribute to all aspects of the process, the division of labor is &quot;amorphous&quot;. You have to &quot;get things done&quot;, to evolve. You can get things done by building shared understanding, communicating, constantly analyzing, evolving and getting at the core of issues. The notion of quality is at once personal, implicit and necessary. This embodies the &quot;individuals and interactions&quot; and &quot;getting to working software fast&quot; concepts of the manifesto.

Better technology could lead to executable models, where there would be more visual and intuitive creation of artifacts, not creation of millions of lines of code/documentation which are really difficult grasp or verify. It could lead to faster realistic prototypes, which may require little or not evolution to get to the final product. Complex systems could be built by using declarative paradigms at every step using artifacts produced in previous steps, in a &quot;machines which make machines&quot; kind of chain.<hr>
<b>Akos Szoke</b>:  (<a href="http://home.mit.bme.hu/~aszoke/">BUTE University, Multilogic Ltd.</a>) &quot;It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.&quot;<hr>
<b>Lucas Lago</b>: Just learned about the manifesto today, in my software class... And I&#39;m giving my support to the manifesto.
I had work with something like RUP before, and now I&#39;m starting to work with agiles process.<hr>
<b>Robert Rodes</b>: I have been developing software, and teaching software development, for quite some time.  I have always intuitively supported, and done my best to practice and teach, ideas along the lines of those you have so clearly spelled out here.  So, I&#39;m very much a supporter.  To the creators of this manifesto I would like to say very well done!  You have clarified important ideas that have needed to be clarified for a long time, and you have done the world of software development a favor.<hr>

<a href="mailto:aajanjua786@gmail.com">Ahmad Janjua</a>: I have used AGILE development methodology for the past two years and loved every minute of it. This how you do the development, give everyone breathing space and get the highest level of commitment on the projects. It works well on software development as well as infrastructure projects, PERIOD.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Jeff@Langrsoft.com">Jeff Langr</a>:  (<a href="http://langrsoft.com">Langr Software Solutions</a>) Agile, done well, is how most of us would prefer to work. I&#39;ve &quot;done agile&quot; for almost ten years, and I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s a step in the right direction. Agile is no silver bullet; I&#39;ve seen enough abysmal agile failures. But when agile goes well, as executed by a team who truly gets it, it goes exceptionally well.<hr>

<b>Nando Sánchez</b>:  (<a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel Corporation</a>) I suffered many years developing software with the waterfall methodology, until a great manager convinced us that Agile was the cure for our suffering. It was not an easy sell for him, because many of us were too used to waterfall to believe that the problems were in the process, not in us, but after doing just one project with Agile we saw the light! NO way back!<hr>

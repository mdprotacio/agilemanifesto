<a href="mailto:nigel.hedges@reece.com.au">Nigel Hedges</a>:  (Reece Group) I am a huge fan of the Agile Manifesto. I endorse it because it underpins 8 values that I have seen over 20 years as being very important to successful software projects (and other products &amp; services). 

Put another way, I&#39;ve worked for some global software organisations that did these things poorly, and I&#39;ve seen first hand their decline in the market.

I think any sane organisation wanting to improve their odds of success, would do this at a minimum.<hr>

<a href="mailto:margusb@gmail.com">Margus Baumann</a>: After seeing how a more traditional project management (let&#39;s call it waterfall) fails in a large software upgrade and implementations, more transparent and agile management methods are always welcomed.
If you are sitting in a meeting and and thinking that who cares about massive contracts that are longer that the project itself and why do we need to follow some procedure that we all know will fail, before it&#39;s started just because it was in a contract, then you should start thinking of using more agile methodologies. I could go on but just take a look on Agile.<hr>

<b>Dino Memovic</b>:  (IT Committee of BEST) Over the time, my programming experience had some painful points. The biggest pains were mostly caused by people focusing on the wrong things. Agile manifesto was a thing that came up when i was starting my career; and in it, in its beautiful four stanzas it encapsulates root of many of the pains caused by wrong focus in projects. If it was up to me every development team would have it written on at least one wall in or near their work space. <hr>

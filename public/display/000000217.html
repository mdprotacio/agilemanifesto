<b>Mike Behrns</b>: Just makes sense.  After practicing and struggling with the excessive amount of overhead in the waterfall methodology for years I&#39;ve begun to realize that Agile is me.  <hr>
<b>Stefani Balam</b>:  (My own) I support the Agile Manifesto just because I am human and as a human I understand We can change our mind at any time, also We like things fast and well done, as a SW programmmer I really love that flexible manifestos like this exists, because they complement our freedom in companies as in personal point of view,

<b>Michal Vallo</b>:  (<a href="http://www.aguarra.cz">Aguarra</a>) I have deployed Scrum on several projects and had opportunity to manage cross company Agile transformation. I found dynamism of empowered teams very energizing and results incredible. <hr>
<a href="mailto:lesjar2509@sky.com">Leslie Jarrett</a>:  (Bank of East Asia) Two recent developments I have done in the organisation I work for have been done in the AGILE Manifesto style. Final signoff to live was easier and actual timescale from start to finish was far shorter than other similar developments with the same business team. The business team were more supportive of the development as they never lost ownership by using AGILE <hr>

<b>Miguel Ribeiro</b>:  (<a href="http://www.webcognoscere.com">Webcognoscere</a>) Delivering quality software that meets customer expectations is an art. To deliver quality software, your team must truly internalize these principles and apply them each and every day. This manifesto should be entrenched in anyone involved in software craftsmanship.<hr>

I share best practices, values and principles to raise people awareness to what I consider be a better way of working, producing results and delivering quality software.<hr>

<a href="mailto:admin@dotlogic.co.za">Pieter Olivier</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dotlogic.co.za">dotLogic</a>) The co-founders of dotlogic were both involved in an agile datawarehouse implimentation at an Investement bank in Cape Town South Africa. We both went through the ups and downs of making it work and the result was a resounding success.
Following on from that high, we both landed back in a waterfall world and it was then that we really saw how well scrum and agile worked. Perspective is sometimes the best school<hr>

<a href="mailto:r.behrman@warwick.ac.uk">Ryan Behrman</a>: Currently doing a dissertation comparing Agile to Waterfall in e-commerce projects. Learning about Agile.. it has a lot of resonance with Customer Focus and bringing the customer inside the organisation rather than keeping them at arm&#39;s length (this is better for the staff, customer, and bottom line). It is similar to lean approaches (less waste = lower total cost of ownership) so it has to be good :) <hr>

<a href="mailto:larouche.bruno@gmail.com">Bruno Larouche</a>:  (<a href="http://www.generationagile.com">Génération Agile Inc.</a>) Agile methodologies are not just a beautiful philosophy. I think this is one of the best ways to make the most of a human in a work context.

One important thing, when we work in &quot;Agile&quot;, you must think before doing things, and especially to take responsibilities, be they good or bad. .. Ultimately, I&#39;m just trying to think outside the boxes!<hr>
<a href="mailto:ascnir@gmail.com">ANIRBAN MUKHERJEE</a>:  (<a href="http://ascendum.com/">ASCENDUM SOLUTIONS LLC</a>) I have been a fan of agile manifesto from long. Since implementation of the latter we found lot values in terms of deliverables with greater functionalities. I thus endorse the Agile Manifesto and appreciate the effort.
All the best.<hr>

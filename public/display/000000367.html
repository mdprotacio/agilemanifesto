<a href="mailto:contact@brehberg.info">Brett Rehberg</a>:  (Brehberg Industries) Agile development set down the foundation for software craftsmanship by identifying the value of change and professional partnerships.<hr>
<a href="mailto:vspkumar.ilindra@gmail.com">Venkata Satya Pawan Kumar. Ilindra</a>: I support Agile, since Agile is the best practice for delivering a good working software with the utmost quality. <hr>
<b>John Kendrick</b>: I have worked and continue to work in the Agile manner.  I support the principles that are outlined and continually challenge myself and my teams to adhere to ensure that this manifesto is achieved...<hr>
<b>Joshua Dent</b>: I think this is great and I endorse all things agile. It should be incorporated into more things.....like government:)<hr>
<a href="mailto:hossein.ansari@gmail.com">Hossein Ansari</a>:  (Elenoon) We use agile in our company to ensure we are more adaptive instead of predictable!<hr>

<a href="mailto:mikecarter771@gmail.com">Michael</a>:  (Consultio Maximus) Given that the businessmen, those with no experience in IT, are open and willing to allow for greater control - the hardest part, often plagued by old men still happy with their outdated philosophies - AGILE is the ultimate in software development. <hr>

I am an Agile (Scrum) professional (Certified Scrum Master, Certified Product Owner) with many years of adopting, practicing, and coaching Agile frameworks for better software program execution, software development, and delivery (Viral Sodha)<hr>
<a href="mailto:russelcantor10@gmail.com">Russel Cantor</a>:  (Agile Practitioner) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:themlkang@gmail.com">Lee Kang</a>: I endorse the principles of agile software development.  These principles are the essence of how the process for developing software should look like.  No person or group can plan or architect software extremely far in advanced.  Constant communication and feedback is extremely important.  I agree to follow these principles and consider what is marketed as &#39;Agile&#39;, &#39;Scrum&#39;, etc.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wilsonmferreira@yahoo.com.br">Wilson Marcos Ferreira</a>: The agile approach is for the software development what the Copernicus theory was for the astronomy.

And I&#39;m very happy to endorse it at all.<hr>

<b>Paul Carey</b>:  (SourceLab Technology Limited) Agility and Lean ways of working create value for all involved.

For the customers, clients, stakeholders, developers, analysts and otherwise anyone with a contribution or involvement to the development of new or existing processes for a business, charity or any other sort of organisation. 

Software is merely one artefact that results from a good Agile process, value for the organisation and the individuals is the end goal and comes in many forms.<hr>

<b>Steve Deackoff</b>:  (IoT advanced business solutions) I agree with the Agile Manifesto and have been following it and the 12 principles for the last 10 years. It has helped and guided me through solving many complex business problems.<hr>
<b>Steven Nicholas</b>:  (SNWare) <td width="233"><b>Marko Umek</b>: Thus software development is knowledge aquisition in the first place, I encourage anyone to practise &quot;agile&quot; methods. 
I know it&#39;s to late. The bullet has left the gun, but I still don&#39;t like the term &quot;agile&quot;, because it&#39;s implies a kind of speed. And because managment people are quite often shallow thinkers, the term &quot;agile&quot; will be translated to &quot;fast&quot;. The term &quot;value driven&quot; would be better ;-). <hr>
<a href="mailto:sambelelenychicupo@gmail.com">Sambeleleny Chicupo</a>.<hr>
<b>Fletcher Bumpus</b>: As a well-seasoned developer of 20+ years I&#39;ve had exposure to many development projects.  Most have succeeded, some have failed and I&#39;ve found that the overarching reason for failure is lack of vision.  In a nutshell, what&#39;s on paper isn&#39;t what the client wants.  

Agile development mitigates this problem.  With the client completely in the loop during all phases of development, and with the development team able to adjust the design as needed to meet the needs of the client AND the software itself, the project stands a much greater chance of success.  This alone makes Agile Development a better way to build software.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:rick.waters@gmail.com">Rick Waters</a>: After all these years, I can&#39;t believe I never signed the manifesto! Through and through, with every fiber of my being, I support the Agile manifesto - the values an principles are how I live my life, not just how I work.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tamara.m.holmes@gmail.com">Tamara Holmes</a>: I have worked in many environments and those that closely follow the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto have had the happiest teams, delivering valuable, quality software at a sustainable pace. More companies need to live and breathe the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<b>Anne BERLANCOURT</b>:  (WLAB) <hr>

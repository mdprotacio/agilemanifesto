<a href="mailto:miuga@atypon.com">mihai iuga</a>:  (<a href="http://www.atypon.com">Atypon Systems</a>) I&#39;ve been exposed to Agile methodology in my previous job within a very large software developing organization.
It was not a happy experiment. It did not work and looking back I can see some of the reasons. I would like to get it right this time. 
Shortly, I’m looking for help.
Thank you,

Mihai Iuga<hr>
<b>Paques, Bernard</b>:  (<a href="http://www.yetanothercommunitysystem.com/">Paxer Conseil</a>) Principles of agile software development and of open source delivery are the main pillars used for the definition and implementation of YACS. Applying an agile approach to an open business model is the probably the most efficient way to leverage talented developers, designers, translators, trainers, and users.<hr>

<a href="mailto:agile@sinamuh.nl">Bert Huisman</a>: Great in its simplicity and powerful in giving increasingly more insights on how to be more effective on a number of levels.

<a href="mailto:vamsidhar.v@psidata.com">vamsi</a>:  (<a href="http://www.psidata.com">PSIDATA</a>) Agile sotware development helps to reduce the risk of large projects. It is a great technique for Project Managers.  It is very much practical and a great methodology for the programmers to adapt to.<hr>

<a href="mailto:ahodge@ciber.com">Alston E. Hodge</a>:  (<a href="http://ciber.com">Ciber, Inc.</a>) <td width="233"><b>Lemuel Formacil</b>:  (<a href="http://sectioneleven.org">sectioneleven.org</a>) We used to spend a quarter of the time writing progress reports and other documents that does nothing but create the illusion that progress is being made.  We also used to spend a considerable amount of time writing system documentation that no developer is actually reading.  We should have just used that time to make real progress--writing code.  Since learning about agile methodologies we focused more on actual development and we became more productive.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bphuan@yahoo.com">Brandon Phuan</a>: I endorse the Agile Manifesto and look forward to an opportunity to adopt the principles in my work environment. 

I also hope to see case studies of practical implementation of the Agile Manifesto especially in the enterprise application arena. <hr>

<a href="mailto:tomas@tuk.se">Tomas Gustavsson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.tuk.se">TUK Kompetensutveckling AB</a>) I have seen the light... working agile is the real way of running efficient projects. 

In a month, I am releasing a book in swedish named &quot;Agile - konsten att slutföra projekt&quot; which is all about these thoughts and concepts.

<a href="mailto:jv.singh@3i-infotech.com">Jang Vijay Singh</a>:  (<a href="http://www.3i-infotech.com">3i Infotech Ltd.</a>) Every single time I have typed code, I have tried to live by these principles - sometimes it hasn&#39;t been easy.
During the past few weeks, I have been reading about agile development and it feels really nice to see these principles as part of a manifesto!<hr>
<a href="mailto:tangcov@gmail.com">Randy Tangco, PMP</a>: I have been into software development and PM and I believe being agile in both will serve the business better in launching its products and achieving its business goals.

In my industry which is banking and payment card industry (card management and EFT system, VISA, MASTERCARD), I believe this would be the most appropriate method.

I hope I can learn more on the practice and application of the agile PM by being a protege to an agile PM mentor .<hr>

I really support the idea of Customer satisfaction through focus on continuous stakeholder involvement, keeping things simple, providing software in a phased manner and welcoming continuous changes and being prepared to handle them.<hr>

<b>Ben Simo</b>:  (<a href="http://QualityFrog.com">http://QualityFrog.com</a>) Good software requires intellegent decision-making throughout the development lifecycle.  Process, tools, documentation, contracts, and plans are all good things.  These can help keep us obtain our goals but should never become a driving force that takes our attention off what really matters.<hr>
<b>Peter TAM</b>:  (<a href="http://mail.gameislive.com/~peter">Gameislive Corporation</a>) We work on mobile online game in China, coincidently we have adopt pair programming, standup meeting technique since 2002, and it was good up to now.

<a href="mailto:sachin_naik@yahoo.com">Sachin Naik</a>:  (<a href="http://www.rolta.com">Rolta India Limited</a>) I look after game development at Rolta. Game development, by its very nature, needs adaptability in its approach since gameplay &amp; fun are intangibles that cannot be decided in the early stages of development. Being nimble footed is critical for successful game developers.

Agile methodologies offer interesting alternatives to traditional SDLC models &amp; I am keen to see these models being used by the games industry in a more informed &amp; aware manner.<hr>

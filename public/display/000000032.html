<a href="mailto:antoniojss@uol.com.br">Antônio João Schwartz Soares</a>:  (<a href="http://http:\\www.accenture.com.br">Accenture do Brasil</a>) I`am so glad to see that Agile methodologies are the answer to build quality software in this age of changing customer requirements, and, I appreciate the deeply humanistic approach of agile software development.
I want to study it.<hr>

<b>Yusuf-Rasheed Reed</b>: Where have I been? I can&#39;t believe I hadn&#39;t heard of this sooner. <hr>
<b>Vinod Varma</b>:  (<a href="http://www.astrainfotech.com">Astra Infotech Private Limited</a>) Software development is too early to be adopted as an engineering discipline though attempts in that direction is laudable. 

In the midst of such a drive, it is important to bring in a realization that craftmanship and people are central to the whole game and would continue to be so for long and that software is the primary deliverable and everything else is supportive, and that never to forget the customer

<a href="mailto:k.prabhakar@altosys.co.in">Prabhakar Kundurthy</a>:  (<a href="http://www.altosys.co.in">Altosys Software Tech Ltd</a>) We commit ourselves to the agile manifesto and strongly propogate these menthods to our software development community. The case in point is that one large automotive firm planned its software application in the year 2000 and  3 well know firms went through the development and failed miserably since they have the faintest idea about iterative and interactive developemnt. We have taken up this project and today the client is convinced after 4 years ! that this method is the only way for any software or project implementation. All support and god speed.<hr>

<b>Alfredo</b>.<td width="233"><b>Jaap Noordzij</b>:  (<a href="http://www.jaapnoordzij.nl">Netspeet beheer</a>) I have been in charge on development projects for more than 25 years as a project manager. During that time I used most of the traditional development methods and project management methods. I have come to see that we, since we now live in a postmodern area, are no longer relying on the &quot;big stories&quot;. Our world had become increasingly complex and thus we revert to the &quot;little stories&quot;: Little methods, merely practices, that have shown to work in practice in the real world. We rely more and more on human relationships and practical results. In my recent projects I have applied the principles of the manifesto in practice and I fully agree with the stated values.<hr>
<b>Pedro Costa</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tryonj@US-Huntsville-CST.mail.saic.com">Jason Tryon</a>:  (ComFrame / SAIC) For years I considered myself a prophet in the wilderness, preaching exactly the things that the Agile Manifesto proclaims.  Since I first encountered Agile Development I have continued to preach it as the best and most sure way to accomplish the goal of my customers.  I am very happy to be signing the Manifesto.<hr>
<b>Giorgos Psaros</b>:  (Various & Diverse) Agile methods, Agile software, Happy customers, Proud developers!<hr>
<a href="mailto:b_zamani@msn.com">Bahman Zamani</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cs.concordia.ca/~b_zamani">http://www.cs.concordia.ca/~b_zamani</a>) I&#39;ve seen a lot of failures in software projects in my country (Iran), due to lack of knowledge about this agile methodologies and trying to use high weight methodologies for small (or medium) scale projects. I beleive that it really works and customers are better satisfied.<hr>
<b>Senthilkumaran</b>:  (Symbol Technologies) Atlast there seems to be a methodology that adopts down-to-earth / useful principles.<hr>
<b>Peter Bennett</b>:  (familus) Even Downunder and Way Out West, in Perth WA this makes sense, particularly to someone with a hard-work disability.  We should all be lightening up. Of course it will also help leave more trees in the ground to do what they do best ... make oxygen, shade and mulch!<hr>
<b>Don Alameda</b>:  (Integrated Automata, Inc.) We at IA have been practicing these principles for years, long before anyone ever put a name to them.

We are so happy that the movement is growing and gaining momentum. This is one of the few methodology directions that I am not afraid to see codified, because by basic priciples the effort is not likely to go overboard and will remain flexible.

I have been a lurker here for a while now, but (maybe because it is a political year) finally feel that the time has come to stand up and be counted.<hr>
<b>Angelo Andretto</b>:  (<a href="http://www.csfb.com">CSFB</a>) I&#39;m using this approach since I was introduced from Frank Mondora, it works and it&#39;s great. Thankyou folks fot all of that<hr>
<b>Tedi Zanfolim</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:Agile.Manifesto@korwe.com">David Hislop</a>: It seems that this process addresses the all too human dimension of software development. How this process interacts with formal corporate structures (budgets, quality systems) and formal proof (of software) develops is something I would like to see mature.<hr>

<a href="mailto:mark.striebeck@gmail.com">Mark Striebeck</a>:  (VA Software) XP and other agile techniques helped us to separate the valuable assets from unnecessary ballast in our development process. The result was a highly motivated and productive team as well as a top-notch product.
As a vendor of Software Development tools we are now trying to deliver the same to our customers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jphillips@gleason.com">James B. Phillips</a>:  (Gleason Works) I have done an exhaustive amount of reading regarding Agile practices and it&#39;s associative metodologies. Thanks to your hard work, shifting through and creating helpful and non-helpful thought processes, I have been allowed to better concentrate on what concepts might best aid our team.

We have a road ahead of us, but feel we have direction, goals, and helpful methods for this development project.

James Phillips<hr>

<b>Wolfgang Slany</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ist.tu-graz.ac.at/">Institut für Softwaretechnologie, Technische Universität Graz</a>) My students translate the agile manifesto into German as a part of the final exam in my course on software development and knowledge management 8-) . IMO it is a good take-home message from the course: When translating the manifesto, they spend time remembering and reformulating for themselves the motives for agile software development methods.</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000031.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

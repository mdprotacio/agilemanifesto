<a href="mailto:srinivas.rowdur@gmail.com">Srinivas Rowdur</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cognizant.com">Cognizant Technology Solutions</a>) I am working on agile for the last 3 months and I am very impressed by it. My client and my company are immensly benifited from it and I hope more people follow this new methodology to create better software<hr>

<a href="mailto:MarcoCardoso@bluebottle.com">Marco Cardoso</a>: Excellent approach. Keep up the great work.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bud@buxcom.net">Alexander John Batyi</a>:  (<a href="http://bud.buxcom.net/">BuxCom.Net</a>) I have have had a project manager refuse to let me speak directly to a customers technical people while the customer was preventing their techs from speaking directly to myself thus postponing a successful integration into the customers system for months.  I could go on for pages about documentation, hard clad software specs., isolation environments, and various cart before the horse requirements.  But the biggest advantage I have seen due to an Agile environment is a better product resulting from ideas passed back and forth between the customer and the coding team.  Not creeping featurism, but little details either from the customers experience with the product or the coders experience with similar human interfaces and such.  I fully support the promotion of these concepts as explained in the Agile Manifesto.<hr>

Working software delivers value, documentation helps the next team;
Customer collaboration over contract negociation but contract must exist;
Responding to change because nobody can think about everything up front.<hr>

<a href="mailto:ian@ianbrandt.com">Ian Brandt</a>:  (<a href="http://ianbrandt.com">ianbrandt.com</a>) I&#39;ve been a proponent of Agile Development since I read the first edition of Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck in late 1999.  The methodology struck a deep chord with me, and I&#39;ve been happy to witness its growing acceptence over the years since.  Here&#39;s to working smart!<hr>
<a href="mailto:srinivas.bt@gmail.com">Srinivas B T</a>: Fantastic concept of making the client and developer interact intimately!<hr>
<a href="mailto:robert.Costello@cgi-ams.com">Bob Costello</a>:  (cgi-ams) <hr>
<b>Kiran Jonnalagadda</b>:  (<a href="http://jace.seacrow.com/">Seacrow</a>) I have no previous experience with the Agile process (though I&#39;ve been aware of it). I happened to find this site today, and your four points make a lot of sense with what I&#39;ve observed in working with teams.<hr>
<a href="mailto:lasse.lilja@iki.fi">Lasse Lilja</a>:  (Within) Nice that emergent facts experienced by all true experts are given a name to preach about<hr>
<a href="mailto:tara@instilsoft.com">Tara Simpson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.instilsoft.com">Instil Software Ltd</a>) Have we finally got over the early adopter stage of agile development?  I certainly hope so, but I fear that too many organisations continue to waste too much money, time and energy valuing the right hand side over the left.   And many of those that do, are lead by people who are not today, nor have they ever been, practioners of the craft - if they were, then surely they would have the common sense to listen to those who speak most eloquently for the rest of us.<hr>
<b>Michal Safranek</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:aaravind@hcltech.com">A Aravind</a>:  (HCL Technologies) I have been involved in building teams and running projects.  I have used most of these principles that are listed as &#39;agile&#39;

Great to see people get together to push people over process in this time of getting CMM or ISO certifications.

Good job on putting some of those team interactions into concise writing.<hr>
<a href="mailto:rtstone@gmail.com">Robert Stone</a>: These are wonderful concepts! I hope that more people view this and that it catches on in the development community. 

Cheers!

<a href="mailto:tiwiex@yahoo.com">Taiwo Akinisho</a>:  (<a href="http://tiwiex.virtualave.net">http://tiwiex.virtualave.net</a>) we developed a softwar in my office and it was a great success considering the time of development. the development team were not bonafide computer scientists. an artist, physicist and an electronics major. we did this the way we could. responded to changes as they happened and bingo we had a functional software in 2 weeks.

i thought we had done it all wrong until i stumpled onto the agile manifesto. i feel much better now. we were naturals.<hr>
<b>Jeroen Schalken</b>:  (<a href="http://www.everest.nl">Everest</a>) Knowledge is the essence in developping software for our clients. This manifesto explains our succesful way of working.<hr>
<b>Jennitta Andrea</b>.<hr>
<b>Andrew McDonagh</b>: As a huge proponent of agile (and XP in particular) I have and hope too, continue extolling their virtues.<hr>
<a href="mailto:debbyku@yahoo.com.hk">debby</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:csantos@alliancetechnical.com">Celio Santos</a>:  (<a href="http://www.atsbr.com">Alliance Technical do Brasil</a>) We are commited to collaborate with our customers, responding to his needs with changes, providing a software that really works for them, creating more value for our industry and enabling our customers to go forward, following the ideas of this manifesto<hr>
<b>Claes Cramer</b>: It&#39;s easy to sign a manifest wherein the people (both suits and blue-collar nerds like me) are favored and seen as the primary source for delivering robust and working software. Moreover, the view where the participants are allowed to make changes when needed instead of the old-fashioned and plan-driven processes where the requirement is looked and frozen before any design and actual implementation takes place is truly worth signing up for. I should have signed this as soon as I begun using XP back in 2001 but I guess I&#39;ve been busy enjoying score cards, unit tests, pairing and many fun refactoring happenings!<hr>
<a href="mailto:ooper@puritysoft.com">Carl Garcia</a>:  (<a href="http://www.puritysoft.com">Puritysoft</a>) Not only does it make sense in business, it also makes sense in terms of innovation, evolution and onshore opportunities.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:vaibhawp@yahoo.co.uk">Vaibhaw Poddar</a>: During my education days I always learnt that software development and management was a art not a science. But all the tools and methods available out there made me feel otherwise. Agile has brought back the Art into Process of Software Development<hr>

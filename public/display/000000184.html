Working software is the primary measure of progress.<hr>

<b>Oliver Smith</b>: I have seen great gains by embracing the principles of this manifesto throughout the software development process.  Thinking smarter about how we develop software right through the process is fundamental to the industries future.<hr>

<a href="mailto:pius.emeya@ubagroup.com">Pius Emeya</a>:  (UBA Group) I Support the Agile Manifesto! Especially in the area of responding to change over following a plan. An implementation plan must be flexible and adaptable to new business needs and other changes that would deliver a better solution.<hr>

<a href="mailto:trevortwining@gmail.com">Trevor Twining</a>:  (<a href="http://pointsoflight.org">Points of Light Institute</a>) Agile is the single most important tool that I use to bring my projects to completion on time and on budget for my department, while ultimately making them more user-centered.<hr>

The agile software manifesto articulates a key issue for business:
when things go well, it is when the principles of agile software are in operation. When things go wrong, business (and governments) attempt to fix them with the principles of control, and compound the problem... Spread the principles of the manifesto through our actions!<hr>
<b>John Drefahl</b>:  (Vodafone) US JiL.org Developer Lead<hr>
<b>danelle peddell</b>: I am a technical project manager and have been using the agile methodology for approx. 4 years.

Getting work done is about managing the people.  I love how the agile methodology values individuals and interactions over processes and tools.  it&#39;s all about the people!

Change is constant.  Agile methodology embraces change in a professional arena.<hr>

<b>Franco Lombardo</b>:  (<a href="http://www.molteniinformatica.com">Molteni Informatica</a>) Working in the ERP software development, I saw so often hard battles between customers and software developers. I and my organization strongly believe in customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and we think that the way of Agile Manifesto is the only one which can lead to better software and better business. <hr>
<b>Muhammad Khair</b>:  (SHAM-SOFT) <hr>
<b>Hartmut Frankowski</b>:  (Vix ERG) Agile is the missing link between the development and project management to obtain customer-centric business development.

<b>Rüdiiger Eckhard</b>:  (Nokia Siemens Networks) I love the simplicity of the values and principles in the agile manifesto.

<b>T. R. Kennett</b>:  (TRKennett) Our MMIS (Medicaid) requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:jbleen@cohaa.org">Jennifer Bleen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cohaa.org">Central Ohio Agile Association</a>) I started learning about Agile Methods in 2006 when I was looking for better ways to manage software projects.  Since then, I have become an Agile evangelist in my community and have seen many companies reap the rewards of being Agile.  The value does not only reside within the development space, but has been realized in the business process area as well. Higher collaboration between the business and development groups has led to better understanding of needs translating into higher quality software and less waste. I look forward to working with others on expanding Agile’s reach to the enterprise.

On a personal note, myself and others in my community have been applying Agile methods to our home lives as well. It is really easy to set up a kanban wall to keep a large family in communication and focused on what matters.  <hr>
<b>Jeffrey Schenk</b>:  (<a href="http://www.DataSchenk.com">DataSchenk, Inc.</a>) Having long been a disciple the principles Agile describes —I am both embarrassed and delighted to discover that where it concerns software, those principles have a name—Agile.  The Agile Manifesto sums up what actually works more succinctly than anything I have ever read or experienced.
Agile puts the focus squarely on producing a useful result: Working software is the primary measure of progress.  Who ever thought common sense could win?  It’s not that secondary concerns are not concerns—they just become secondary.  I’d be humbled to be added to this list of innovators.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sascha.teske@microprojects.de">Sascha Teske</a>:  (<a href="http://www.microprojects.de">http://www.microprojects.de</a>) I first heard about XP in 2005 and had no clue how to adopt it then. But since I liked the idea immediatly, I did my first project with XP in 2006. I wouldn&#39;t want to work in other environments anymore. And to make the world a little better I also guide enterprises into using scrum or kanban or whatever amalgamated methods suit them.<hr>
<b>Akeda Bagus</b>:  (<a href="http://htttp://gedex.web.id">Personal</a>) I&#39;ve been in software development for more than two years. I&#39;ve faced the difficult situation in some projects and thought &quot;Geez, software is hard!&quot;. I blame my clients for his inconsistencies on requirements until I read Martin Fowler&#39;s book and know about agile methodology.<hr>
<b>M. Sami Kuzey</b>: I believe, agile values and practices bring great value to software development. I really can&#39;t think of suffering with other approaches any more.<hr>
<a href="mailto:s.venkat.sai@gmail.com">Venkatanarayanan Srinivasamurthy</a>.<hr>
<b>Ed Kenny</b>: I want to work in an industry where the delivery of what the customer wants is top of the list and we can respond and be flexible at the same time as being disciplined and great craftsmen.

I strive for effective and rapid delivery.<hr>

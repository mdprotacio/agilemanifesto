<a href="mailto:rob@agidem.com">Rob Westgeest</a>:  (<a href="http://www.agidem.com">Agidem</a>) Many people claim know good ways to write good software, on time, within budget. Most of them are plain wrong. I think you&#39;ve made some important points and i like the way you put it.<hr>
<a href="mailto:hts@antares.no">Håkon T Sønderland</a>:  (<a href="http://www.antares.no">Antares Gruppen AS</a>) While no silver bullet, I believe that agile software development is the way forward.  It would be good to be able to enjoy programming and not writing meaningless document for once!<hr>

<a href="mailto:markh@westmarine.com">Mark Hanna</a>:  (<a href="http://www.westmarine.com">West Marine, Inc.</a>) Bravo!  I&#39;ve been in business application development and project management for 15 years, and I&#39;ve seldom been impressed with the available project management or software development treatments that computer professionals are held accountable to.  They just don&#39;t make sense in the business world.  Your manifesto struck a chord in me, such that I am printing it out to share with my development staff and executive management as well.  I applaud your efforts!  <hr>

<a href="mailto:mgogoi@hotmail.com">Mridul Gogoi</a>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:Mark@Graybill.com">Mark Graybill</a>:  (<a href="http://www.exbsolutions.com">EXB Solutions</a>) I&#39;ve studied human nature for a couple of decades, and the implications and affects human nature has on software engineering for many years.  The Agile Manifesto is right-on when it comes to what should be valued on software engineering/development projects.

Software is engineered/developed entirely in the conceptual realm of the human mind without the benefits of physical science that other engineering endeavors have.  Therefore, the conceptual integrity of the software product throughout development is much more critical than any other engineering endeavor.  The way to ensure conceptual integrity is focusing on people and human nature - just what Agile does.

Electrical engineering has &quot;gone Agile&quot;, only they didn&#39;t know it.  They can design, develop, manufacture, and test electronic components before it even leaves the desk of the engineer.

Therefore, why is so much of the industry moving toward bigger and heavier phased processes - as if they are making it more like other engineering endeavors, when those endeavors mostly have already abandoned the idea?

<b>Jaana Wayrynen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.dsv.su.se">Department of Computer and Systems Science, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden</a>) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:vanschoo@acm.org">Nancy Van Schooenderwoert</a>:  (<a href="http://www.xp-embedded.com/">XP Embedded Co.</a>) For years I&#39;ve been collecting software development methods from various projects, teams, companies that really work. I continued to use and refine them. When I discovered XP, I was already doing most of its practices!  My engineering background had made me a &#39;true believer&#39; in BDUF and specs. Goodbye to all that!!

  There is no going back. I co-founded XP Embedded Co. so I&#39;d never have to go back to the bad old ways, and so I can show others how to do embedded development extreme.

  Years of working with software developers who sat all day like monks in their cells, never communicating until too late...
  Being marooned on Death March projects, searching for a way out...
  Working for managers who view software developers as galley slaves... 

  ...all fueled the idea that people-centered AGILE software development is the answer. I went from Art major in high school to Computer Engineering major in college, and the common thread is creativity.

  Agile methods will reach far beyond software development - this is the way to do complex, creative work of all kinds.<hr>

<b>Ken McClure</b>:  (Lumio) Careful, this could put Scott Adams out of business!  Congratulations guys, for articulating what most of us have been thinking about for way too long.  I&#39;m starting to see a lot mnore job adverts daily which ask for experience in Agile methods, and I hope it&#39;s a sign that both managers and customers are seeing the benefit in this approach.<hr>
<a href="mailto:smanoj@nesttech.com">Manoj Sankar</a>:  (<a href="http://www.nesttech.com">NEST Technologies Inc</a>) Based on my 12 years of software development and project management experince, to me Agile manifesto looks very pragmatic and promising. But in the case of a large product development with multiple geographically separated teams, how this can be applied is what I am experimenting now.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ranjit_sandhu@sra.com">ranjit sandhu</a>:  (<a href="http://www30.brinkster.com/rsandhu01">sra</a>) RIGHT ON!!! not that this stuff isn&#39;t obvious to intelligent people :) and has been around in academiea for donkey&#39;s years, but i would like to DOUBLE RATIFY this manifesto (and i&#39;m using my real name on the web!!! sacre bleu!)<hr>

<a href="mailto:halls2@hotmail.com">Steve Hall</a>:  (<a href="http://www.hotspotglobal.com">IntraPower/Hotspot Global</a>) I&#39;ve been using agile principles for several years now with good results. There is a need to strike a balance between what goes down on paper (e.g. design, process, scope) and what remains &quot;agile&quot; to handle the moving target of the delivered application. Using open source is great in this model because we can swap a software component out without needing to revamp a mountain of associated overheads. Good stuff! <hr>

Thanks, folks!  I&#39;m proud to be part of a new beginning...<hr>
<b>Tim Burns</b>:  (<a href="http://tim.owlmountain.com">Owl Mountain Software</a>) I support the agile alliance manifesto because it supports working iteratively on a project and addressing defects on different granularities.  If you code test-first, then you are iteratively applying tests that address fine-grained defects.  If you do acceptance testing, then you validate that the fine-grained tests work together to implement the feature.  If you release often, then you validate that the features together implement a product that is useable, robust, and serves the customers&#39; needs.<hr>

<a href="mailto:jens_coldewey@acm.org">Jens Coldewey</a>:  (<a href="http://www.coldewey.com">Coldewey Consulting</a>) I support this alliance because I think it&#39;s one of the most powerful movements in the past, combining technical excellence with a humane perspective. If we understand that work is not (only) technique but living together with other humans, professional life would be much easier.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ssmith@campuspipeline.com">Stephen K. Smith</a>: After years of involvement with software 
development processes that have a high failure
rate, I have seen something that works beyond
any expectation.  In my admittedly limited
experience  with the Agile approach, I have 
found that with these light methodologies it
is easier to write code that is more simple, 
more maintainable, more testable, and more 
defect free, all in less time than it takes 
to go through a heavy weight process.  Accepting
the inevitability of change prevents putting
lots of time and effort into building complex
&quot;reusable&quot; code that will just be replaced
anyway.  Processes, tools, documentation, 
contract negotiations, and plans all have their
place.  I really believe success will be more
likely if we put them back in their proper
place.<hr>
<a href="mailto:agile@chadfowler.com">Chad Fowler</a>:  (AVeryLargeUnNamedCompany) Agile methods are less about software construction and more about humans working together and communicating.  No matter what field you&#39;re in, there&#39;s something to learn here.<hr>

<a href="mailto:laurent@bossavit.com">Laurent Bossavit</a>:  (<a href="http://www.bossavit.com/">JustaDeveloper</a>) Paradigms are shifting. Not only in &quot;mere&quot; software development, but in the &quot;sciences of design&quot; as a whole; those concerned with explaining and taming systems as diverse as living organisms; the human mind, self, and societies; and that most intricate product of the mind that is software. The Agile Alliance stands as a signal example of what this shift in values and viewpoints is capable of achieving.<hr>
<a href="mailto:clapesco@mindspring.com">Bill Clapes</a>:  (Clapes & Associates, Inc.) I fully support the inclusive and collaborative nature of the Agile Manifesto. Development teams must work hand-in-hand with business knowledge owners to acquire a clear vision of the business intent for an application and must be open to the fact that the business intent can change.<hr>
<b>Sven Gorts</b>: These values, although often overlooked, remind us what software development is all about.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:jonas.ivarsson@consafeinfotech.com">Jonas Ivarsson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.consafeinfotech.com">Consafe Infotech</a>) I think the four statements exactly catch the essence of what modern software development is about.

<a href="mailto:francesco.mondora@mindview.it">Francesco Mondora</a>:  (<a href="http://www.mindview.it">Mindview Italy</a>) I support the agile alliance manifesto because it can give benefits to the customer and developers. 
In our company we work applying Agile Methodologies and we are gaining a lot of benefits. The iterational model and the defeacts addressing make an Agile Developing Life Cycle. In this way customer needs are kept in mind by everyone. 

Thanks to all those &quot;guru&quot; who are thinking about quality software and quality methodologies.

<a href="mailto:murray.white@ams.com">Murray White</a>:  (American Management Systems, Inc.) I most recently used Agile Process methods in coaching a team of 30 developers and 15 testers to develop the first phase of the Illinois SACWIS application - you can read about it www.ams.com/ State_and_LocalGov/ Downloads/ IllinoisSACWISv2.pdf.
The application just entered acceptance testing with no defects.  We built it in about 5 months from when I started applying Agile techniques.  We are now focusing on going full scale Agile - some variation of Crystal Orange - for the second phase of the project.  If you face a project with uncertain requirements and significant time-to-market pressure, Agile works *and* your teams will probably be happier too.

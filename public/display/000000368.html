Change can take many different forms: change in requirements; change in legislation; change in product direction; change in budget; change in timescales; and most importantly change in user experience. The last point is also why I endorse Agile. You must be able to regularly show product to the business. There is no other way to fine tune user experience for today&#39;s market. <hr>

<a href="mailto:Saptadeep.Dutta@gmail.com">Saptadeep Dutta</a>:  (MobiMedia) I endorse Agile thinking and its methodologies and also support its proponents.<hr>
<b>Matthias M. Schneider</b>: I endorse the agile manifesto and methodologies following it because we need this change in software engineering and development to take place now. Long enough has developing software been a dysfunctional ménage à trois of customer, consultant and developer in non-agile environments. In engaging and integrating the customer in the software design and development process, delivering a functional product early on and iterating over it with feedback-loops reminds me of the arts of tailoring where the client continuously gives feedback to the tailor during the process of creating an individual and extraordinary piece of craftsmanship.<hr>

<a href="mailto:jharcourtpg@gmail.com">James Harcourt</a>:  (Railroad Commission of Texas) I agree with the idea that people, communication, change, and results should prevail over process, plans, and negotiations.  General Eisenhower once said &quot;Planning is everything but the plans themselves are useless&quot;. Success or failure in Information Systems is more a function of human relationships than methods, hardware, and software. I have found that converting the phases of large projects into a series of smaller projects each with their own micro phases and go, no-go decision points often adds value, control, clarity, and risk reduction. Its like Mandelbrot&#39;s concept of the Fractal. The largest most complex and beautiful objects in nature are just reflections of simple molecular shape(s) which combined layer upon layer, and minor imperfection upon minor imperfection, into the largest and most complex and robust macro structures that make up our world and our Universe. <hr>

<a href="mailto:diogo.kamioka@gmail.com">Diogo Key Kamioka</a>:  (Computer Scientist) I feel we are living dark times for Agility. It seems it has grown over itself and became a buzz word. That&#39;s good and sad at the same time.

I work really hard to make people understand the uncertain and the unknown. (3U) And one of the best ways to tackle this kind of world is to be agile.

I endorse the principles. I am no master of Agility, and I always come back to this page to make myself remember why we do what we do.

It&#39;s our duty as supporters of the Agile Manifesto to always stop, think, evaluate and respond to change. Even the manifesto itself. Let&#39;s see how things work out in 10 years :)<hr>

<a href="mailto:bruce@brucedungey.net">Bruce Dungey</a>:  (brucedungey.net) I have to sign a manifesto with so much commonsence and usable principles.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ramapu@techmahindra.com">Rama Krishna Pulivendla</a>:  (TechMahindra Ltd) We had transitioned an Agile project from onsite to offshore and were successful in the same. Our experience on Agile says that it requires self discipline and excellent time management. This is a very good learning for both the developers and project manager as it provides good balance between professional and personal life. At the end of the day everyone is gaining from Agile!<hr>
<b>Matthew Krout</b>:  (<a href="http://www.omnicare.com">Omnicare, Inc</a>) There is no doubt that agile development takes a lot of coordination and great employees to pull it all off, but it&#39;s worth the effort and I would not want to do it any other way.<hr>
<a href="mailto:reliablendn@gmail.com">Subhash Gupta</a>:  (<a href="http://ThouoghtWorks.com">ThouoghtWorks</a>) I believe this philosphy has more power than any other for building a reliable working software in the competetive market place but on the other side, it requires right blend of right kind of people to maximize the efficiency of whole idea.

<a href="mailto:chief_odusote@yahoo.co.uk">Ayodeji Odusote</a>: The only way to move forward is moving forward. Agile methodology is the way to get agile with development right from the very conceptual start to the upredictable end.<hr>

<a href="mailto:smbeebe@gmail.com">Susan M. Beebe, PMP</a>: Agile is an excellent model for iterative web development projects.  Effective management includes tight integration between development teams and business customer units.  Collaboration, fluid team communications and trust are fundamental tenants of the Agile methodology and must be adhered to for successful results.  Agile provides the business with immediate turnarounds (results) on deliverables; furthermore, it allows for scalable designs.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Scott_Cole@Cargill.com">Scott Cole</a>: Our organization is just beginning the transition to Agile.  I believe it will be painful, annoying, and cause lots of conflict.  But in the end, it should speed development, increase employee engagement, and be personally rewarding. <hr>

<a href="mailto:kdakan@yahoo.com">Koray Dakan</a>: I&#39;ve been working in a project where 
1) changing from one source file to another in the &quot;visual&quot; editor might take a minute or so, 
2) building project files to see the effect of a small change in source takes five minutes, 
3) you see your changes overwritten in a &quot;source safe&quot; environment, 
4) getting latest source that can be built is virtually impossible, 
5) people don&#39;t share ideas and knowledge and don&#39;t care in general, 
6) meetings are done on every weekend only to force people to come and work on the weekends, 
7) project leader doesn&#39;t have a project plan, occasionally asking everyone what they&#39;re doing now, 
8) endess cycle of requesting extension periods from the customer over the previous deadline, 
9) bosses bashing customers and workers, customers bashing the company, 
10) analysis done from head, without talking to the customer,
11) constantly working on the framework 
to make it work instead of working on a &quot;working framework&quot;

etc.

all leading to an unsuccessful project..

Even industrial project management has learned to deliver working prototypes and getting constant feedback from target customers before going on to full production.

I pity those who work in a dynamic sector as software development and insist on old and wrong ways of doing business.<hr>

<b>Abhijit Hiremagalur</b>:  (<a href="http://www.hiremaga.com/">Cogent Consulting</a>) This signature is long overdue, what you started with a single match is now a raging fire.

Thank you for planting the seed that&#39;s grown into the work environments I look forward to going to each morning.<hr>
<b>Anna-Jayne Metcalfe</b>:  (<a href="http://www.riverblade.co.uk">Riverblade Limited</a>) I&#39;ve encountered many processes in the course of my career, but all of them had one thing in common - they *didn&#39;t* work. The Agile Manifesto is something very different - an approach rather than a rigid process.<hr>

<a href="mailto:eisanchez@magsaysay.com.ph">Edwin I. Sanchez</a>:  (Magsaysay Group of Companies - Manila, Philippines) Our organization is very dynamic and requirements usually change. Doing a waterfall approach can not deliver what the customer wants on time. Agile is the answer. <hr>

And the passion was rewarded by seeing it all come alive whilst working with Egg to help them develop their agile development organisation<hr>
<a href="mailto:gustavo.garcia@earthlink.net">Gustavo A. Garcia</a>:  (<a href="http://www.pmpit.com">http://www.pmpit.com</a>) I believe the Agile methodology to software development is the most innovative and efficient way to manage development of new applications, ensuring business owner participation and having the results of the end-product be driven by the business, ensures proper alignment of technology behind  the strategic vision of any organization.  We need to keep in mind that software solutions are nothing without a business need.  Technology supports a business not the other way around.<hr>

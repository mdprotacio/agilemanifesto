<a href="mailto:joseyukio@gmail.com">Jose Yukio Akazawa</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ericsson.com">Ericsson</a>) Yes, I do endorse the Agile Manifesto. I believe that&#39;s the way.<hr>
<b>Ralf Finchett</b>:  (<a href="http://www.pmoplanet.com">PMO Planet</a>) Traditionally PMO&#39;s are all about documentation, process and governance.

Although there is a strong need for documenting a project, there is an equal requirement for delivering a successful project, through high performing individuals and teams.

Projects are about people, and the Agile Manifesto improves the ways people interact, generate solutions, and deliver products which are fit for purpose, whilst still controlling the project.

It&#39;s not rocket science ;-)

<a href="mailto:computingfreak@gmail.com">Milind Shah</a>: Agile Software Development is the best choice when in-depth analysis and documentation is not a priority or primary requirement. Agile Manifesto handles Evolution with Simplicity.<hr>
<b>Mike Levings</b>: Few things have come along and revolutionized development practices like the simple principles set out in the Agile manifesto.  We always try to complicate things in life and yet time after time, find out that simplicity is almost always better.<hr>

<b>Adrian Higgins</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:shareenwarshanna@gmail.com">Shareen Warshanna</a>: I endorse the Agile Manifesto in its entirety.  The only way to truly measure a projects success is does the project deliver value.  I view Agile as not only a methodology but also a motivator. Seeing working software delivered at short intervals is truly a team motivator.  It is easier to be dedicated to something that you see value in.  Agile, to me, is way of life to keep things in simple chucks and don&#39;t get so bogged down in the details.  Focus on collaboration. After all, a developer can&#39;t effectively develop a working software in a vacuum without knowing what the customer is looking for.  It is better to find out early if it is possible to deliver and the what to deliver.  <hr>

Since the business processes owners know the business processes well, the unbounded collaboration between them and techies help in developing a real solution that can give value to business<hr>

<b>Robert Matheson</b>:  (<a href="http://www.robertmatheson.com">http://www.robertmatheson.com</a>) Shifting my mindset to Agile has produced benefits both personally and professionally. One must deconstruct their preconceived notions regarding software development, set the ego aside and commit to the values and principles outlined in the manifesto. It&#39;s not enough to understand them, you must apply them every day.  I highly recommend Agile for software development and professional growth. Happy coding!<hr>

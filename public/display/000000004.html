<a href="mailto:vgunst@online.no">Vidar Gunstvedt</a>: I have during the last 3-4 years discovered and promoted the principles behind the Agile Alliance as the ONLY workable way of developing and promoting software. I fully support you!<hr>
<b>Björn Ek</b>:  (<a href="http://www.DSDM.Org">DSDM-Consortium Sweden</a>) The Agile Manifesto is the perfect way to stress the basic issues that are the very foundation of methods like DSDM. THIS is the future of software-development.<hr>

<a href="mailto:p.bossi@quinary.com">Piergiuliano Bossi</a>:  (<a href="http://www.quinary.com">Quinary</a>) The value of agile principles goes well beyond the scope of being more effective, more productive or more efficient.<hr>

<b>Tim Breitkreutz</b>:  (<a href="http://www.softwarebrewmasters.com">Software Brewmasters</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:ugo.landini@sun.com">ugo landini</a>: All that heavy stuff is just cumbersome... do they think programmers are only pawns or  what?   <hr>
<b>Daniel Stephan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.mobidata.net">mobidata GmbH</a>) Every developer should put this manifesto over his/her desk
as a reminder.<hr>
<a href="mailto:anuraag_awasthi@hotmail.com">Anuraag Awasthi</a>: A happy employee means a happy customer. A happy employee exhudes team spirit and collaboration within the team, with the customer and the end users.

Moreover, software is made for people and by people. This people focus has been missing 
in traditional approaches. 

An Agile approach understands this basic truth.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mandarins@mindspring.com">Salvatore Lentini</a>:  (Mandarin Software) I am an independent consultant in NYC, concentrating most of my software development in various trading systems in C++ and JAVA. I have read and enjoyed the documents concerning the Agile Manifesto. I agree with the manifesto but often find it difficult to work through the steps mentioned because of obvious reasons...people are inpredicable, business units don&#39;t want to spend money, many IT managers are from the old school of thought( mainframes, cobol, etc ). I guess you see where I am getteing at. But I hope to read more interesting articles on the Manifesto in the near future. <hr>

<a href="mailto:billbarn42@hotmail.com">Bill Barnett</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:m.amiano@ieee.org">Mitch Amiano</a>: It is said that life innovates by making many cheap mistakes, allowing the cost of individual failures to approach zero. The values reflected by the Agile Manifesto will have a similar effect. Prioritizing people, relationships, outcomes, and effectiveness can hardly be called &quot;common sense&quot; in an industry populated by introverted theorists and as yet dominated by cold war management styles. The Agile Manifesto deserves our recognition and support.<hr>

<a href="mailto:MattS@Possiamo.com">Matt Scilipoti</a>:  (<a href="http://www.Possiamo.com">Possiamo Consulting LLC</a>) Thank you for lighting the fire.  Not only does it light the way a little, but the sparks get me up off my bum.  The ideas you are sharing have brought a new level of energy to software development.<hr>
<a href="mailto:private@georgsehl.com">Georg Sehl</a>: During several years in Software Quality Assurance I always have felt that there must be more about testing software than putting test cases and bugs on file, writing huge documents and tuning sophisticated processes. The agile approach points the way ahead.<hr>
<b>ZJ Chen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.srs2.com">SRS2, Inc</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:joshuar@techie.com">Joshua Reynolds</a>: Me too.<hr>
<a href="mailto:carrie@aegisoft.com">Carrie Biles</a>:  (<a href="http://www.aegisoft.com">Aegis Software Inc.</a>) Aegis Software Inc. supports and employs the Agile Software development methodology.<hr>
<b>Jeff Grigg</b>.<td width="233"><b>Andrew Rosenfeld</b>: The grassroots effort behind agile methods is quite impressive, and in time hopefully academia and management will see the agile perspective as a valid, respectable alternative. The existing agile processes have yet to evolve and mature... it should prove to be an interesting journey. <hr>
<a href="mailto:J.Warmer@klasse.nl">Jos Warmer</a>:  (<a href="http://www.klasse.nl">Klasse Objecten</a>) As co-author of the UML standard people usually think I love large and detailed models. The contrary is true, a model is only worth building if it directly helps to achieve the final goal: building a working system.
With the emergence of MDA tools, it becomes possible to directly move from model to code. This &quot;promotes&quot; models from being merely documentation to becoming part of the delivered software, just like the source code.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bo@leuf.com">Bo Leuf</a>:  (<a href="http://www.leuf.com">Leuf Consultancy</a>) Author of The Wiki Way (Addison-Wesley 2001, with Ward Cunningham) and Peer to Peer (Addison-Wesley 2002), my focus has generally been on the communicative and collaborational aspects. Web site management and software development has long been aligned with the manifesto princples.<hr>
<a href="mailto:timw@dvc400.com">Tim Woodard</a>:  (<a href="http://www.diamondvisionics.com">Diamond Visionics Company</a>) What&#39;s the alternative?<hr>
<a href="mailto:pclanton@earthlink.net">Paul Clanton</a>:  (<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~pclanton ">http://home.earthlink.net/~pclanton </a>) As an IT business management consultant, IT manager, software development manager and project manager, I have found the beliefs and principle of the Agile Alliance to be applicable for any IT related project.

I am proud to support the manifesto and the principles behind them.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mccabe@software.org">Rich McCabe</a>:  (<a href="http://www.software.org">Software Productivity Consortium</a>) Here at the Consortium we&#39;ve been supporting CMM/CMMI-related work and services for many years. Yet, even though our members perform the very large military/government projects that cannot do without the &quot;heavy weight&quot; methodologies, it has become obvious that many other member projects have a crying need for an agile approach, and we have been recommending it, as appropriate. Cockburn makes the case very well that there is a place for both light- and heavy-weight methodologies in this world, although agility is an important quality to consider on any project (and overall has not been receiving sufficient emphasis -- hopefully proponents of agile thinking can improve the situation).<hr>
<a href="mailto:steve@threewisemen.ca">Steven Vetzal</a>:  (<a href="http://threewisemen.ca">Three Wise Men</a>) Agile programming offers the best methodologies for web projects, where relevance is often measured in days and weeks, rather than years. Traditional top-heavy design can miss the mark, or create over-complicated systems that require too much time to build or require too much hardware to deploy.<hr>
<a href="mailto:webmaster@java.at">Thomas Eichberger</a>:  (<a href="http://www.java.at">Thomas Eichberger GmbH</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:justin_t_sampson@yahoo.com">Justin Sampson</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:aaronsansone@yahoo.com">Aaron Sansone</a>: As a software developer and consultant, I have found that Agile development is the Mecca I have been searching for.<hr>
<a href="mailto:peter@engcorp.com">Peter Hansen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.kaval.com">Kaval Wireless Technologies Inc</a>) Director of Software Engineering. 
I believe agile approaches (in our case XP) are revolutionizing software development. 
More important to me is that my team 
is making much more progress, producing higher quality code, and having more fun (less stress) than ever before with non-agile approaches.<hr>

<a href="mailto:keith@landrus.org">Keith Landrus</a>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:ndehi@solutionskenya.com">Ndehi Karonjo</a>:  (<a href="http://www.solutionskenya.com">Solutions 2000</a>) We have been practising alot of extreme programming but we did not know it was a methodology that had a name. We kinda stumbled into parts of it. The following has been particularly useful.

- Bringing a senior Clients representative into the team. Working side by side with a client&#39;s rep allows fast decisions to be made, produces the best design and better acceptance by the other users. Its also a great way to make long lasting friends. 

- Paired Programming always produces better and more practical code. Conding standards are easier to keep when people are working together.

- Courageous refactoring. If the code is bad then it should immediately be rewritten.

I&#39;d like to learn more on agile methodogies<hr>
<a href="mailto:gskrishna@ieee.org">Sri K Ganjam</a>:  (<a href="http://www.semanticspace.com">SemanticSpace Technologies Ltd</a>) I always used to complain about changing requirements, with Agile methods(XP in my case)I found it easy to adapt myself to the changes and be more productive.<hr>
<a href="mailto:simeon.fitch@mseedsoft.com">Simeon H.K. Fitch</a>:  (<a href="http://www.mustardseedsoftware.com">Mustard Seed Software</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:jrafter@us.ibm.com">Joe Rafter</a>:  (IBM Global Services) Clients consistently request functionality and features to be built via applications and systems using multiple technologies. The Agile Manifesto articulates our preferred behaviors to respond to our client&#39;s requests. Our solutions, as well as our behaviors, should reflect the spirit of the Agile Manifesto. The manifesto will be exhaulted when we as an industry deliver agile solutions and architectures with agile behaviors to fulfill our client&#39;s requests. I am reminded of the saying &quot;the only thing that is constant is change&quot;. We should embrace this change with the Agile Manifesto.<hr>
<a href="mailto:draxten@yahoo.com">David Draxten</a>: Simply Wonderful!<hr>
<a href="mailto:jbrewer@jera.com">John Brewer</a>:  (<a href="http://www.jera.com/">Jera Design</a>) I&#39;ve been using agile methods since early 1998, and XP for the past couple of years.

These days I consult in the San Francisco Bay Area, helping companies adopt XP and other agile methods.

I maintain the Extreme Programming FAQ, which can be found at: http:// www.jera.com/ techinfo/ xpfaq.html

I helped found BayXP, the San Francisco Bay Area XP Users Group.  (All users of agile methods are welcome, as are the agile-curious.) http:// www.jera.com/ bayxp/<hr>
<a href="mailto:john.mcmanus@sema.co.uk">John McManus</a>:  (SchlumbergerSema) I am interested in all aspects of agile design. As an international author in systems management I am also interested in furthering knowledge in systems engineering.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tudor_girba@yahoo.com">Tudor Girba</a>:  (<a href="http://www.lukit.de/tudorgirba">home page</a>)  How would it be to be passionate about your work? How would it be to go to work and just play? Nice, I think. But how could you convince a manager to let you? Anyway, I think that this site is one of the steps in that direction.<hr>
<a href="mailto:hruschka@b-agile.de">Peter Hruschka</a>:  (<a href="http://www.b-agile.de">Atlantic Systems Guild</a>) The manifesto put in words what successful projects have experienced but could not explain.
Following agile maximes succeeds over formalizing the process.<hr>
<b>Kareem Qureshi</b>: Yes I think that is one most efficient way of coding.<hr>
<a href="mailto:oespinoza@egginc.com">Oscar Espinoza</a>:  (EG&G Technical Services, Inc.) Providing excellent services to our customers and client base, while accelerating the quality of flexible code has never been better defined as in the agile programming techniques.  IT is and will continue to be challenged by the global, economic and political requirements facing suppliers, venders and customers. Successful shops employ the &quot;3F&quot; practices (functional, fast, flexible) found within the agile programming techniques. IT implementations are successful when business strategies are achieved (customer satisfaction and increase of profit margins).    </td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000003.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

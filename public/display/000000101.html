<a href="mailto:rochak@dmwtechnologies.com">Rochak Chauhan</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dmwtechnologies.com">DMW Techologies Pvt Ltd</a>) We truly support this manifesto. Agile development has to be the backbone of Web 2 or for that matter Web 3.

In my opinion, waterfall model and other conventional software processes and models more or less apply to handful of projects.

Our Best Wishes,
Rochak Chauhan.<hr>

<a href="mailto:yvonleclerc@hotmail.com">Yvon Leclerc</a>: I’ve applied agile to new and legacy products, mature, start-up, product, or research-based organizations. The methodology ensures we follow the best practices we have developed the last 20 years. It has provided to the software industry, a new generation of professionals.<hr>

<b>Nigel Pepper</b>:  (<a href="http://whereisnigel.co.uk">BT</a>) My experience of software development to date has brought me to realise the true merits of Agile development.  What the Cluetrain Manifesto is doing to marketing, so Agile is doing to Software development.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mhmd28@hotmail.com">Mohammad Khair Mohammadia</a>:  (<a href="http://www.progressoft.com">Progress Soft Incorporated</a>) Heavy and Traditional Processes obstruct the project of meeting with its most important goals, or it gets distorted. and sometimes incomplete or hardly integrated. having experienced both methodologies, i believe agile is much more direct and benefitial to the project and most importantly, the customer.<hr>

<b>widi</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:satish_13_sharma@hotmail.com">Satish K Sharma</a>: Quality concerns have been of paramount importance since the beginning of software development. One of the best parts in agile development is in managing and dealing with the user and system requirements by the self-managed team members individually. I have no doubt that continuous attention to excellence by one and all the team members can result in the production of software with enhanced quality and with in the stipulated budget and schedule in the present era with increased code size and complexity.  With ever increasing dependability of software, the need to promote sustainable development and to produce reliable software is all time high. <hr>
<b>Murthy</b>: I have worked on a few projects which followed a custom tailored agile methodology.  Quite interested in the benefits and growth of this new process of software engineering.<hr>
<a href="mailto:abbner@gmail.com">Abbner Torres</a>: This is wonderful.
I need to learn more and start to apply this manifesto as well as Agile Software development.

Congratulations.

<a href="mailto:GLipson@NumberSix.com">Gregg Lipson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.numbersix.com">Number Six Software</a>) As I Decision Information Technologist, with a career spent focusing on web based collaborative, data driven applications, mostly under the Waterfall methodology for large Federal Government organizations, I have seen first hand why it simply does not work. There is a reason over 75% of IT applications fail to hit targets and over 30% never get rolled out. Attempting to apply a CMMI style oppressive system of comprehensive documentation, structure, and rigid conformity, adopted from manufacturing theory, also does not work for software development.

The answer as I have experienced, lies in real collaboration. To me, this is the key. Not a buzz word about it or aligning business and IT, but genuine close collaboration, face-to-face and real-time, with the stakeholders/customers as well as the software engineering team, from end-to-end. It lies in using an iterative/incremental, working software centric process that embraces and responds to change rather than fearing it. In a nutshell, what works is an agile methodology.<hr>

<b>José Augusto Schneider</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:susan@abbottresearch.com">Susan Abbott</a>:  (<a href="http://www.abbottresearch.com">Abbott Research & Consulting</a>) I&#39;m not a software developer, but I&#39;ve led some large scale change projects and honored the philosophy behind the principles. (Sadly, many organization&#39;s project management philosophies lean heavily towards the stuff on the right.)

Agile principles make a lot of sense in the world of customer experience design (my passion) and are essential for good results in  qualitative research projects (how I make my living). 

Wishing you well from the world of strategic marketing and customer experience.

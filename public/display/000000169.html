<a href="mailto:phil.ryan@isite-solutions.com">Phil Ryan</a>:  (<a href="http://www.isite-solutions.com">iSite</a>) At iSite we spent 2009 adopting a small number of Agile practices to help us deliver a number of key projects. These proved very beneficial and complementary to the way we like to do business.

In 2010, now that the &quot;old dogs&quot; (incl myself) have experienced the benefits of some of these practices, I hope now to engrain the Agile methodology and this manifesto into how we do business going forward. 

For me, the Agile manifesto is a simple but powerful message which succinctly describes the way forward for our industry.  As less and less &quot;code&quot; remains under our direct control the Agile values of &quot;Individuals and interactions&quot;, &quot;Working software&quot;, &quot;Customer Collaboration&quot; and &quot;Responding to change&quot; become strong foundations for delivery success.

Using these principles we were able to save significant time on the schedule, review development work much more frequently and improve on past product quality. The face to face meetings gave our developers valuable feedback regularly and helped them with understanding business process needs much more clearly. Many changes were generated, even towards the end of the development cycle. Being open to that was a new experience to many of them, but few want to return to the past environment. We will continue to use the agile principles in all of our projects going forward.<hr>
<b>tandy sean arnold</b>:  (<a href="http://www.tandysean.com">TSA Photo and Design</a>) This is the best way to develop. Customers and team work better together, if there are problems they are front and center and with client involvement and project evolution the end product is always satisfactory.<hr>
<a href="mailto:hardus@gmail.com">Hardus</a>: I will try my utmost best to adhere to the principals set forth in the manifesto to empower me and my colleagues to perform at our best.<hr>
<b>Kris Leech</b>:  (<a href="http://interkonect.com">Interkonect Services UK Limited</a>) Agile values allowed us to continually develop the Nottingham Information Prescriptions Project to better meet the needs of our customers instead of delivering lots of features at once in hypothetical new versions of the website. This allowed progress to develop organically over time in response to real need not the desire to just add features.<hr>

<b>Carlos Gomez</b>: in over 20 years of IT and software development experience, it was until we started using the agile methodology when I saw a big momentum building in project delivery. Our Agile team has been very successful using the methodology.<hr>
<b>Matthew J. Hughes</b>:  (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewjosephhughes">http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewjosephhughes</a>) Now that agile has become ubiquitous in business, software and process improvement, I find I often have to point people back to the Manifesto to clarify what Agile is, and more importantly what it is not. We’re not saying tools, contracts, documents and plans are evil or unnecessary; we are saying that our *focus* is on the higher-order items of people working together over time to deliver tangible value to the business. 

Decades of industry research demonstrate that when we move away from these agile principles, we move towards project failure.

Do more with less.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jbrook05@comcast.net">Jeff Brooks</a>:  (Delta Dental) I&#39;ve been doing software development for over 20 years at a large IT company using traditional waterfall development processes, with the exception of a couple projects doing iterative and test driven development. After switching to a company last year that was focused on doing agile/iterative software development and having the opportunity to lead some of the projects, I would never want to go back to a waterfall approach. The results have been amazing. Because the team is working from day 1 together on short releases, past communication issues associated with traditional hand-offs disappeared and the business people have become huge fans of the process since they are seeing value in a short period of time. They see very quickly the ability for the project to adapt to change and appreciate the ability to get their highest value features delivered early in the project.<hr>

<b>Dmitriy Khmaladze</b>:  (<a href="http://www.itadapter.com">IT Adapter Corp.</a>) I&#39;d like to endorse and undersign every tenet of this manifesto. I have been using these principles for 15 years and indeed productivity   and fun self-emerge when you do things the natural way.

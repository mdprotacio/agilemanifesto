Davis</b>:  (IBM GS - AS (Gov and Ed)) Clearly, iterative deliveries with multiple opportunities to change scope and function during a development effort is the key. Finding ways to enable Agile development within larger procurements (especially in Public Sector where single procurements are most often reliant on large, deliverable-based contract vehicles) can be both effective in reducing cost and risk for the supplier (us) and for the taxpayer (us!). This is more than a technical issue - but will require contracting and legal efforts as well.<hr>

<b>Ermogenes Palacio</b>:  (CEETEPS/UNESP) I&#39;m a teacher of computing in Brazil and I try to spread that technic in my classes.
In Brazil, we support!<hr>
<b>Jeffrey Palermo</b>:  (<a href="http://www.jeffreypalermo.com">Palermo Consulting</a>) I started out and was in fact educated in sequential waterfall processes.  In industry I found this less than desirable.  Through reading and other forms of knowledge-gathering, I came upon the Agile Manifesto and found the principles I agree with.  Now, as an independent consultant, I am an Agile Coach.  As a teacher of these principles, I have learned more about them than when I was studying.  I can absolutely say I have found more success with the principles than without them.<hr>

<b>sergio velasquez</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:jonas.jepson@jadestone.se">Jonas Jepson</a>:  (Just now representing myself) My experience says that this manifesto is extremely applicable in its right environment, and when developing software the environment is often right. I would wish the manifesto to be slightly longer. There are more things I would sign to. Like:
Customer and consumer value over almost anything else.
Willingness to succed over fear to fail.

The Customer collaboration over contract negotiation is a tricky statement because everyone needs to be able to pay the rent by the end of the month. And why is it customer collaboration over contract negotiation rather than something else like minding your own business or sticking to the contract or goldplating.

<b>Stephen Smith</b>: The Agile Manifesto is a clear expression of how the software development industry can better adapt to change and better deliver business value. In my years as a software developer I have learned the hard way that change cannot be avoided, delayed, or ignored - and that agile development practices Just Make Sense.<hr>

<a href="mailto:bdijkstra@xebia.com">Barre Dijkstra</a>:  (<a href="http://www.xebia.com/">Xebia IT Architects</a>) Agile is the natural evolution of focus on quality and value. The principles carry a value that does not only apply to software development but to any kind of development.
The focus on the principles do not pose an utopia though, but has significantly, in practice, improved software development as a whole.<hr>

Its not just a new possibility but a new REALM of possibilities.

We were able to accompolish a project in 45 days, what the &quot;next best bidder&quot; asked 2 years for - that&#39;s agility!<hr>

Its principles are unfolding the
real nature of software development<hr>

<b>Raghavendra Singh</b>:  (<a href="http://www.gnvfc.net">GNFC Ltd</a>) Great News that a new software development help is comming up. Please see to it that like others this also does not become a developers nightmare by needing expensive lectures to learn first and then keep gruping how to implement the various diagrams in his project.<hr>

<a href="mailto:knut@dpmas.com">Knut I Stenmark</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dpmas.com">Dynamic Project Management AS</a>) Being able to respond to changes, is like being responsible for business benefit. The world is changing, our environment is changing; even the organisation we are working in. All this is affecting our business requirements, and should thereby also be reflected in our projects.<hr>
<a href="mailto:vareddy74@yahoo.com">Ambareesh Reddy</a>:  (<a href="http://www.aalayance.com">Aalayance E-Com Services Pvt. Ltd.,</a>) I am impressed very much with the Agile Manifesto.

<b>Talbott Crowell</b>:  (<a href="http://www.thirdm.com">Third Millennium</a>) The Agile Manifesto is an important doctrine to follow and is key to successful software development.  More importantly, the manifesto&#39;s heightened value of the individual increases job satisfaction, which increases productivity.<hr>

<a href="mailto:alex.hunt@dissc.com">Mr Alex G Hunt</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dissc.com">DISSC Ltd</a>) I have been a practitioner of what is now called Agile Programming for most of my working life. Real-world systems are by definition agile.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sai.matam@shankerson.com">Sai Prasad Matam</a>:  (<a href="http://www.shankerson.com">Shankerson Consulting, Inc.</a>) Agile is not a silver bullet. There is no substitute for 
thought and hardwork.  Agile should not be mis-understood
as an &#39;undisciplined way&#39; of doing things. In the coming
years the propounders should clarify the agile concepts.<hr>
<a href="mailto:srob@objvis.com">Simon Roberts</a>:  (<a href="http://www.objvis.com/">Objective Visions</a>) We&#39;re increasingly finding that Agile process (particularly XP) ways of working can be useful outside of software development as well. We now do a substantial amount of our management using &quot;pair managing&quot; and strategic planning using something similar to the XP Planning Game.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rama@iiitmk.ac.in">ram potty</a>:  (<a href="http://www.iiitmk.ac.in">IIITM-K</a>) Agile Methods is a step towards simplified software process than heavyweight stuff.
More over it integrates with many process styles like XP very well .

<a href="mailto:mburleson@cds-agile.com">Michael Burleson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cds-agile.com">Collaborative Development Strategies</a>) Agile is a culture as much as it is a collection of processes and tools. Collaboration makes it possible. Any new product development (software or otherwise) is wild and untamed. Agile expects and respects this. RAD meets REALITY! CDS is dedicated to moving Agile forward in the development and BUSINESS community.<hr>

<a href="mailto:smangal@cymbal.com">Shailesh mangal</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cymbal.com">Cymbal Corporation</a>) I like agile because its the best methodology which provide maximum flexibility to customer and developers. I have been working in one of the agile methodology called XP(X-treme Programming) and I almost love it by heart.<hr>

We have a strong developer community which, as it happens, already tends to follow the ethics of this manifesto. With the growing acceptance of Agile philosophy, I have a better chance of successfully overcoming client conservatism and educating more to go along with the Agile approach.

<b>M. Abdur Rasheed</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:webmaster@knowledgeautomation.com">Marc Clifton</a>:  (<a href="http://www.knowledgeautomation.com">Knowledge Automation</a>) I and my team have successfully developed large scale engineering and process management software using the principles of the Agile Manifesto.  Modern software development must take into account rapid advances in technology and customer requirements.  In addition, many customers do not fully understand that an existing &quot;paper&quot; process does not translate 1 for 1 to a software process.  Nowhere is this more true than in an engineering and process management fields, where existing processes can be so &quot;subconscious&quot; that they actually become hard to define by the customer.

It is vital therefore that the software development team develop agile software--software that is delivered early, in incremental steps, and can support late requirement changes.  Built-in flexibilty is a key component of this.  Frequent face to face design meetings and delivery presentations is essential to ensure that the team is on track with the customers&#39; expectations.

Not only is it important to use the right design models, but existing tool sets (such as Microsoft&#39;s Foundation Class library) and current software implementation practices all but ensure failure in supporting agile software development.  It is therefore vital that the development team enhance existing tools so that flexibility and traceability is at the foundation of the software implementation.  The Agile Manifesto is key to this success.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bsamwel@xs4all.nl">Bart Samwel</a>: While working as a software developer I have often found that development teams depend too much on processes and too little on interaction with and paying attention to customers and each other. As my friend Jeroen Vermeulen told me, methodologies are usually a systematic way to overlook things. And the things most often overlooked are changing requirements, or even the fact that requirements are incorrect or incomplete. Once the goal becomes satisfying a static, frozen set of requirements, you can forget about the real goal, which is delivering a product that satisfies the only requirement that counts - making your users happy. I therefore support the principles of the Agile Manifesto.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sander.hoogendoorn@ordina.nl">Sander Hoogendoorn</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ordina.nl">Ordina</a>) As one of the authors of Ordina SMART, one of agile methods, I fully support the agile manifesto. I hope that in the years to come more and more project teams will rethink the way they work and co-operate and implement the principles in the manifesto. Having experienced such projects I can only say that it works better, project teams become far more flexible, and even more important: projects are more fun.<hr>

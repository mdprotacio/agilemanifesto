It&#39;s heartening to see more and more colleagues arguing the contrary - it is the methods that are flawed, for they demand that people embrace what they find difficult at the expense of what people do well (i.e., communicate).<hr>

<a href="mailto:steve@khatovartech.com">Steve Hayes</a>:  (<a href="http://www.khatovartech.com">Khatovar Technology</a>) I believe that creating software is an act of shared discovery, performed by people, for people. We won&#39;t be satisfied as developers, and we won&#39;t have satisfied customers, until we learn to value the social and technical sides of our craft equally. The Agile Manifesto is an important first step in reforging the craft of software development.<hr>

<b>Joel Rieder</b>: I support the agile Manifesto. I am working hard to convince my organization that process for the sake of process (design for the sake of process, etc.) just doesn&#39;t work. I have found we have forgotten whom we build software for (i.e. the &quot;customer&quot;) and agile works to improves this relationship.<hr>
<b>Shailesh M. Sonavadekar</b>:  (TEIL) <hr>
<a href="mailto:Jarmo.Miettinen@moremagic.com">Jarmo Miettinen</a>:  (MoreMagic) <hr>
<b>Bill Kunz</b>: Though I&#39;m a PMP, I fully embrace the manifesto and am looking forward to an agile future!<hr>
<a href="mailto:tobias.fors@citerus.se">Tobias Fors</a>:  (<a href="http://www.citerus.se">Citerus</a>) Becoming and staying and open-minded ever-communicating software developer is not an easy task. On the other hand, it is not impossible either. The existence of the manifesto shows us that it can be done, and tells us something about the results we can expect when we walk the right path.<hr>
<b>Volodymyr Bezprozvanniy</b>:  (<a href="http://www.programm-art.com">Programm-Art Studio</a>) All of my life I worked in that manner 
and now I had been very plaeasant to 
know that my special manner to work with my customers became THE NAME of Agile Programming !!!
I have to say you only that:
My (ours) programs are not is quite 
The Program Product, but they work hard
at their places.
So especially I support that manner of programming.
The first: needs of my customer,
the second - other things.
With my pleasure to my Customers
and colegues.

<a href="mailto:tweiland@charter.net">Tim Weiland</a>: I have come up with three principles for software development that I believe in:

[1] Software Development process should follow a &quot;path of least resistence&quot; which supports (not hinders) the ability for developers to produce quality code that meets customer requirements.

[2] Albert Einstein&#39;s quote is applicable: &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.&quot; (I prefer it over &quot;K.I.S.S.&quot;)

[3] Take responsibility for your actions:  You break it, you fix it - but I can certainly help you. (especially good for aspiring developers)

I feel the light-weight processes of the Agile movement provide the framework (rules and steps) for me to work within my principles.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jrichnow@geologist.com">Jens Richnow</a>:  (MakeTXT.com and ScieSoft) Back to common sense! Makes software development in all its facets and phases to feel like a worthwhile and enjoyable experience.<hr>
<b>Ramakrishnan J</b>: Simply wonderful. Every IT Organization should chant this Manifesto every day and adhere to it.<hr>
<a href="mailto:vickoff@compuserve.com">Vickoff Jean-Pierre</a>:  (<a href="http://www.RAD.fr">Méthode RAD France</a>) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:jallen@nmr-inc.com">Jon Allen</a>:  (Jon K Allen, Inc.) The successes experienced in 20+ years as an application developer have been directly related to how closely I followed the principles now espoused in the &quot;Agile Manifesto&quot;.  I learned these principles the hard way, through trial and error. It gives great satisfaction to know that they are beginning to receive the recognition they deserve. I extend kudos to the framers of this manifesto.  I am delighted to add my support.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ron@tolido.com">Ron Tolido</a>:  (<a href="http://www.tolido.com">Cap Gemini Ernst & Young</a>) As the author of IAD (Iterative Application Development, one of the &#39;early&#39; agile development approaches) I can do nothing else than fully endorse the excellent principles behind the Agile Manifesto. Volatility is here to stay!<hr>
<b>Sean Heston</b>:  (Sprint PCS) Common sense SDLC philosophy. What a concept.<hr>
<b>Russ Schlicht</b>: This is a straight-forward, no-nonsense approach to software development.  Agile Development makes so much sense in practice, as to make any other approach almost laughable.  Don&#39;t lose sight of your customer!<hr>
<a href="mailto:james.todd@sun.com">James Todd</a>: the truth ... plain and simple.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sthornock@drivecorp.com">Scott Thornock</a>:  (<a href="http://www.drivecorp.com">Drive Development Corporation</a>) <hr>
<b>Kay Johansen</b>:  (<a href="http://verio.com">NTT/Verio</a>) As a QA Manager in an Internet company, I am very interested in the ability to increase quality of software without sacrificing agility of process.<hr>

<a href="mailto:cnantais@rednaxel.com">Chad Nantais</a>:  (<a href="http://rednaxel.com">Rednaxel Interactive</a>) Customers can gain and enjoy competitive advantage by having wokring software that is scaleable and customized to not simply address their needs but to their way of evolving.  The Agile principles create a flexible framework which guides the development process and creates new possibilities for achieving vital goals.<hr>
<a href="mailto:pac1@tiac.net">Patrick Callahan</a>: Has anything less than this ever resulted in true customer satisfaction with the result.  I fully subscribe to these principles and encourage thier adoption in the organizations I belong to.<hr>
<a href="mailto:andrea.lambruschini@katamail.com">Andrea Lambruschini</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:damith@hsenid.lk">Damith C. Rajapakse</a>:  (hSenid Software Intl) A great effort to push the industry towards more pragmatic methodologies. I hope that this is only the beginning of a great journey. I&#39;m with it, all the way!!<hr>
<a href="mailto:jorgen@larsen.name">Jørgen Larsen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.jorgen.larsen.name">Homepage</a>) I fully support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<b>Jef Knutson</b>: The manifesto is a crucial statement. As a prescriptive statement of sw development values, it affirms that people who develop sw for computers do so as people, not as computers.<hr>
<b>Ronald Willems</b>:  (<a href="http://www.utopics.nl">Ordina Finance Utopics</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:neal.mcwhorter@mail.com">Neal McWhorter</a>:  (<a href="http://www.beggsheidt.com">BeggsHeidt Enterprise Consulting</a>) As a practitioner of &quot;Agile Process&quot; from before the term was coined, I am optimistic that a core of skilled practicioners can help bring pragmatic process to the industry and by doing so, overcome the barriers to transforming chaos into inspiration.<hr>
<b>Nabil Elhage</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:rossomandop@acm.org">Phil Rossomando</a>:  (Unisys) I would like to participate in this effort from the standpoint of people being the most important resource. Too much lip service is given to this phrase. It&#39;s about time that our industry came to realize that it&#39;s not only technology that makes a project successful but the people involved. That we must count on eachother to get the job done and if we can&#39;t, all the technology in the world will not do the job. While I too am against make work I also believe that that methodology which we do have must be understood and used properly. Like the people as most valuable resource phrase, most companies use the term methodology without understanding what it is. We must think smarter in the software industry and we must learn to appreciate what we each bring to the table.<hr>
<b>Norman Rekitt</b>: There is only one way to develop software. 
Without Fear.
Without Ego.
With Speed.
With Agility.
With You.<hr>
<a href="mailto:lex.borger@cmg.nl">Lex Borger</a>:  (CMG) The manifesto puts into words what we intuitively practiced or wanted to practice.  It is not about getting stuck in explicit process and requirements, but about dynamic collaboration and a willingness to change.  Reflecting upon my career, the projects I am most proud of are indeed the projects that embraced most of these values.<hr>
<a href="mailto:lombardijj@manhattangroup.com">John J Lombardi</a>:  (Manhattan Group) Remember: &quot;Knowing the path is one think... Walking it is another...&quot;

The simplest things are sometime the hardest to accomplish and also the keys to success.<hr>
<a href="mailto:omar@uow.edu.au">Omar Garcia</a>:  (University of Wollongong) I could not agree more<hr>
<a href="mailto:developer@geocities.com">Anton A. Mints</a>:  (AOT N.V.) <hr>
<a href="mailto:crgardner@charter.net">Christopher R. Gardner</a>.<hr>
<b>Tim Bacon</b>:  (<a href="http://www.primeeight.co.uk/">Prime Eight</a>) The agile manifesto sets out what the most productive programming teams have understood for years. I hope that its emphasis on practical common sense spreads beyond this site and its founders, into the heart of the software development community.<hr>
<a href="mailto:holger@knublauch.com">Holger Knublauch</a>:  (<a href="http://www.knublauch.com">FAW Ulm</a>) I am currently finishing my PhD thesis on the application of agile processes to the development of knowledge-based systems and multi-agent systems. My results have been successfully validated in an XP course in which I acted as coach. We particularly came to value pair programming and testing for the development of a clinical multi-agent system. Please check my homepage for details.<hr>

<a href="mailto:emmy@snowdolphin.com">Mary-Ellen Harrison</a>:  (<a href="http://www.snowdolphin.com">snowdolphin</a>) Focusing on delivering value just makes sense to me.<hr>
<a href="mailto:channingwalton@mac.com">Channing Walton</a>: I strongly support the principles of the agile alliance and its manifesto. Software development desperately needs these new and bold ideas if it is to move away from the sad state it finds itself in today. The principles of the alliance is the way forward.<hr>
<a href="mailto:finney@ACM.org">Michael Finney</a>:  (<a href="http://vcard.acm.org/~finney">mission in life</a>) My mission in life is to use my strongest skills which I most enjoy using, in a place I am called to be, satisfying a hunger the world has. The Agile Manifesto is a declaration of using our skills to the fullest, anywhere we&#39;re called, and satisfying the world&#39;s hunger for great software.  The actualization of its potential is not always easy, but it is the next step in our evolution.</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000002.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

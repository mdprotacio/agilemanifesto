<b>Anitha</b>: In 2012, I came to know about agile manifesto and its principles when our software product development team started using agile principles. 
Since training, I have been using &amp; advocating agile principles throughout my software development career. Slowly I started realizing this agile principles can be applied to all nature of work rather than only software. Currently, as a sustainable management student, I am relating this principles across industries. 

This manifesto also stands for epitome of collaboration<hr>

<a href="mailto:isaac.linkletter@gmail.com">Isaac "Link" Linkletter</a>:  (Quality Engineer) Developing strong quality teams requires the implementation of tight feedback loops and digestible chunks of functionality, to ensure that corrections and improvements can be enacted quickly, before further development obfuscates the original issue, and possibly complicates fix actions.
The Agile Methodology sets a solid framework for ensuring that quality teams can fully support their developers and ensure that the right thing is being built the right way, with a minimum of waste.<hr>

<a href="mailto:thomas.poirier@persystence.com">Thomas Poirier</a>:  (Persystence, Inc.) I have developed or managed the development of software since 1990.  I first became aware of the Agile approach, and of the manifesto perhaps as early as 2003, and thought it was primarily focused on project time frames and budgets.  I was a professional deeply steeped in heavy weight models that believed process was the key.  I became an unconvinced practitioner in 2006, and over the years have come to realize that Agile&#39;s primary impact is on QUALITY, as measured by a solution&#39;s ability to meet it&#39;s user&#39;s current needs in the best possible way.  As I have come to appreciate the cultural norms that are most successful in delivering high-quality solutions in a timely, cost-effective means, I have come to see Agile as the true democratization of the software development process.  Indeed, I think it is a pattern for managing everyone.<hr>

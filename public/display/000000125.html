<a href="mailto:ian@frysystems.com.au">Ian Fry</a>:  (<a href="http://www.frysystems.com.au">Fry Systems Pty Ltd</a>) Starting in the mid 1980&#39;s with 3GL approaches I modified my approach, planning and delivery of software along Agile lines. Combined with the power of current development tools, and a modified approach to the Capability Maturity Model, I am getting better customer solutions and experiences at reduced cost to them, and a higher follow on rate for new work for my company.
The Manifesto spells out a summary of approaches which includes, improves and expands on the techniques which have evolved in my practice over the past 20 years, and so represents an excellent starting point for any newcomer. The completeness of the areas covered by the manifesto contributes to its acceptance as a viable framework.<hr>

<a href="mailto:satyaprakash.ranjan@fmr.com">Satya Prakash Ranjan</a>:  (Fidelity) These principles were the basic and fundamental principles of software development before formal processes came in. Agile revives all of these, however care should be taken to not forget agility while working in an Agile mode<hr>

<b>Faizulla Shaik</b>:  (<a href="http://www.s7software.com">S7 Software</a>) My company is now in a transition phase from Unified Development processs to Agile process as project development methodology. As we are implementing the same, we are also working on establishing the best practices of Agile model.<hr>
<b>Mark Kofahl</b>:  (<a href="http://www.siteflex.com.au">Siteflex International Pty Ltd</a>) The Agile Manifesto encapsulates the principles with which we have been working for many years for our Siteflex Web Content Management Systems, as well as Mailflex, FormFlex and E-Commerce systems. Self-organising teams with the means to achieve are measured in their success by the usage of the software developed.<hr>

<a href="mailto:presuppositionalist@yahoo.com">J. Mark Hord</a>:  (Sr. Software Engineer) So long as software development remains a human endeavor, mistakes will be made and plans will change.   The secret to good software development is not chasing the 0-defects or mechanical processes that cannot eliminate error with further layers of complexity.  The secret is found in learning to thrive in an uncertain environment where human beings make mistakes and plans change often.   In short, they put the theories of Col. John Boyd to work in the realm of software.  See Chet Richards wonderful little book, _Certain to Win_ for more on this approach.   Agile let&#39;s software engineers do what they do best.<hr>

<a href="mailto:saishankar.c@gmail.com">Sai Shankar Chandrasekharan</a>:  (Cisco Systems) Agile methodologies define the real and efficient way software must be developed.<hr>
<b>Fabrice Cathala</b>:  (SaaS Consultant) The Agile approach is both simple and efficient. The developers evolve in a less stressful environment and the customer ends-up with a better product.
This is purely revolutionary, and it works!<hr>
<b>Rodolfo Solis</b>:  (CICE) <hr>
<b>Roland Jochems</b>: Agile software development is the way to get and keep customer satisfaction and trust. The customer feels understanding of his/her concerns and requirements.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ramsuri24x7@gmail.com">Ram Suri</a>:  (<a href="http://www.softproindia.com">Softpro Global</a>) There are no rules to gaining customer satisfaction than providing an exact solution and Agile methodology in itself aims at rapid delivery, improved cooperation between Service Provider and Customer over series of direct communication. <hr>

<b>Stuart Robertson</b>:  (Thapsia Limited) Good positive directions, I like what I see.<hr>
<b>Ronaldo Blanc Rocha</b>:  (Summa Technologies do Brasil) <td width="233"><b>Kevin Kane</b>:  (CGI) Discovering that others had formalized some of the same issues and concepts around modernizing software development that I had been struggling in isolation with for years was an exhilarating revelation. I have gained much from the experience and wisdom of those who support this manifesto, and wholeheartedly do so myself. Thank you.<hr>
<b>Ryan Garver</b>: I&#39;ve been using varying degrees of agile techniques for a number of years.  It has finally culminated to complete dedication in the practices surrounding the agile manifesto. This works, and it works well, and it will continue to get better.<hr>
<b>William Niu</b>:  (Tektronix) It&#39;s exciting to attach my name to this great manifesto. It brings me the feeling of joining a holy religious organization. Let&#39;s hold this belief and expect good result!!<hr>
<b>David Strauss</b>:  (<a href="http://fourkitchens.com/">Four Kitchens</a>) In the last two years of working on projects with clients, it has become clear that expending effort to fight change is an ineffective strategy for maximizing business value. Agile strategies allow us to focus on how we can say &quot;yes&quot; instead of building elaborate systems for saying &quot;no.&quot;<hr>
<b>Trevor D. Reid</b>:  (<a href="http://www.trevor-reid.com">Trevor Reid || MBA-Law Student Blog</a>) I haven&#39;t yet done as much I&#39;d ultimately like to do, but I do start conversations about agile values and principles wherever I go, whether as a customer or developer.<hr>
<a href="mailto:dary.merckens@gmail.com">Dary Merckens</a>:  (<a href="http://sportsnation.espn.go.com/">ESPN.com</a>) This is easily one of the 10 best manifestos that I&#39;ve signed<hr>
<a href="mailto:randy@ec-stratagems.com">Randy Bennett</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ec-stratagems.com">EC Stratagems</a>) Finally, an approach that includes so much of what I have tried to make a part of whatever methodology I have had to apply!<hr>

<a href="mailto:michel.goldenberg@goldentec.ca">Michel Goldenberg</a>:  (GoldenTec) <hr>
<a href="mailto:han.schouten@idealogic.nl">Han Schouten</a>:  (IdeaLogic BV) I have seen project management methodologies come and go. Most of these turned out to be nothing more than extensive checklists that require you to do many things that don&#39;t directly contribute to the project goals, yet cost time and energy that could have been spent in better ways. This manifesto expresses the need to return to the essence of any human effort and to the requirements that I value most: commitment, competence, determination and collaboration.<hr>
<b>Sid Lothian</b>:  (<a href="http://www.woodwhistle.com">Woodwhistle</a>) Working in the not for profit sector (Trade unions and collecting societies) the humane, collabarative approach works perfectly.

Agile gives me, my team and my customers a real sense of a project progressing.<hr>

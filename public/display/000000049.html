I see myself again in the quoted problems<hr>
<b>Rajeev Dixit</b>: Agile development focuses on the individuals - Customers and Developers. Over the years, I have realised that ability to respond quickly while recognizing the fact that change is inevitable is key to successful software development.<hr>
<b>Malay N D</b>:  (IBM) This Software development methodology is the best way to match client expectations by delivering the right mix of requirements within the phased time frame. <hr>

<a href="mailto:pete@trailridgeconsulting.com">Pete Behrens</a>:  (<a href="http://www.trailridgeconsulting.com">Trail Ridge Consulting</a>) The Agile Manifesto represents an evolution and maturity in software development that recognizes the human factors required for true innovation and quality. However, that does not make software development any easier - it is still a very unpredictable and complicated process. Recognize that agile transformation takes patience, experience and strong leaders.<hr>

<b>Philip A. R. Fennell</b>: Customer collaboration and responding to change are the key factors in good customer relations.    <hr>
<b>Chris Hudgins</b>:  (Gaslight Computing Machines LLC) <hr>
<a href="mailto:cody.shive@the-arrington-group.com">Cody Shive</a>:  (<a href="http://arrington-group.com">The Arrington Group, Inc.</a>) Traditional software development has failed.  Forced processes, over-documenting, litigious negotiations and rigorous plans have conspired to create not only underwhelming software but a bad perception of the Information Technology industry as a whole.  Customer Service took a back seat.  The Agile Manifesto merely accepts a common sense approach to software development embracing our world of never-ending change.  Process, communication, documentation, and planning are essential elements of balanced software development and delivery; but they are a means to an end: high quality software with phenomenal Customer Service.<hr>

<b>James Naylor</b>: Having managed many software development projects that almost as soon as they started turned into &quot;out of scope discussions&quot;, I&#39;m eager to apply the Agile methodology!<td width="233"><a href="mailto:pradipta.guha@gmail.com">Pradipta Guha</a>.<hr>

<a href="mailto:s.bobick@verizon.net">Stephen Bobick</a>: I advocate using Scrum, with a sprinkling of XP practices, and judicious use of Use Case Modelling and UML.  The results have been phenomenal:  better products, and a better working environment!<hr>
<b>Josh Hone</b>.<hr>
<b>Rolly Dimaandal</b>: The agile manifesto is plain common sense for
developing useable software. You guys nailed
it right on the head. Agile is the way to go!<hr>
<b>David Smith</b>: Software development is development by compromise. Wake up to the agile world and smell reality!<hr>
<b>Ettore Berardi</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ack-ack.it">ack-ack.it</a>) Italy<hr>
<b>Sachin Sharma</b>: I am working as an analyst in the clienr centeric environment of a software development company. We have been trying hard to fulfill the customers expectations by using out of box methodologies but that didn&#39;t prove to be very fruitful.Thanks to the Agile methodologies,we have succesfully competed a project by truly beliving in the spirit of Agile Manifesto.
I see a very bright future for the methodology as well as the people using it.<hr>

<a href="mailto:zvonimir.durcevic@gmail.com">Zvonimir Durcevic</a>:  (<a href="http://www.i-new.org">I-New Mramor</a>) Communication, flexibility, goal oriented approach, but at most belief that people can and will do the job done, are some of the values and principles that Agile Methods brought to me. 
Supporting Agile Manifesto is supporting a way of doing the job with the customer for the customer. 
Let us deliver.<hr>

<a href="mailto:philip@woosh.co.nz">Phil Lascelles</a>: At last, an approach to development that has the user needs and therefore addressing the requirements understanding as a priority over technical elegence and ego. It might not &quot;cure world hunger&quot; but it will succceed where I have seen failure of custom projects again and again over my 30 years in this industry.  The customer wins for once !!<hr>

<b>Stephen Ocean</b>: IT projects have historically had a very high percentage of failures. Many IT professionals have responded by trying to plan things in finer detail. All this results in is enormous efforts going into a specification that is frequently out of date the moment it is published. 

What&#39;s needed are better communication structures and methods, not more planning. Agile programming depends on frequent feedback loops that keeps project members in synch.<hr>
<a href="mailto:rajeev.vashista@ge.com">Rajeev Vashista</a>: I think this is the best idea ever struck in the software development arena. I am greatly influenced by your manifesto and principles<hr>
<a href="mailto:petur@pos.is">Petur Orri Saemundsen</a>:  (<a href="http://pos.is/">http://pos.is/</a>) I believe Agile values and principles will eventually be dominant in all software development.<hr>
<b>Simon ALEXANDRE</b>:  (<a href="http://www.cetic.be">CETIC</a>) Working since almost five years in the field of software process improvement and assessment I strongly believe that Agile methods bring fresh air and innovative ideas in the SE field. <hr>

<a href="mailto:javier.loucim@gmail.com">Javier Loucim</a>:  (BASF) First time ever that I read something that we at our work are also discovering and trying to build (an Agile Methodology).
What I wanted to share with you, is that in our experience is not only important the relationships between people (developers and clients (that is different from a customer!)) but also is important the relationships and commitment to the methodology between developers, analysts, managers and the clients.
All in all, we are trying to get down to reality level a methodology that help us develop and document at the same time in order to have &quot;live&quot; documentation based on the changes and developments that arises within the development process itself.
Things are not easy, but at the end I think that this is (the Agile Manifesto) the only way to adapt the IT industry to this ever changing world.<hr>

Expecting the user to be able to define all the requirements fully and accurately is a recipe for disaster.  Prototyping separately from real development is a huge waste of time.  Iterative development is always going to happen, so using it as an official technique makes all the sense in the world.<hr>
<a href="mailto:fgarcialainez@gmail.com">Félix García Lainez</a>: I agree with all the principles of the Mainfesto, specially with the following &quot;Working software is the primary measure of progress&quot;. I like specially their emphasis in building great products, giving more importance to &quot;what you do&quot; instead of &quot;how you do&quot;.<hr>

<a href="mailto:info@speedysearch.ca">Justin Burgess</a>:  (<a href="http://www.SpeedySearch.ca">Speedy Search</a>) I fully support and endorse the twelve principles of Agile Software. Since implementing these values our company has benefited from a dramatic increase in ingenuity, creativity and productivity.  Our success could not have been achieved following any other methodology.  We have exceeded expectations and our clients could not be happier.  The Agile manifesto must live on!<hr>
<b>MILJAN BAJIC</b>:  (<a href="http://www.miljan.com">http://www.miljan.com</a>) I fully support the values and principles of the Agile manifesto. In our world today, change is the only constant and adaptability is a prerequisite to survival. It is vital that we quickly adjust to change and embrace it in order to survive. This growing need for faster and more adaptive solutions to problems is increasingly leading us to be Agile. <hr>

<a href="mailto:marco.groppi@gmail.com">Marco Groppi</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sistinf.it">Sistemi Informativi</a>) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:deronyates@gmail.com">Deron Yates</a>:  (<a href="http://http://www.sheffieldscientific.com/">Sheffield Scientific</a>) I&#39;m a firm supporter and practitioner of the Agile Manifesto. I&#39;ve been in IT for over 20 years. In that time, I&#39;ve unknowingly been a supporter and user of Agile Development principals even before it was formally defined. It just seems natural to me to always be responding to change so that problems are quickly solved. Flexibility to customer&#39;s needs is what brings true value. You have to expect that the customer doesn&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know - and that is OK.

As opposed to traditional development methodologies, which too often become black holes sucking up money and resources. Many a time I&#39;ve witnessed execution of projects for the project plan&#39;s sake. The babies are crawling to the edge of the cliff and no one is willing to adjust their stance to save them and find them a new direction. The unwillingness to change or deviate from the established plan is what often causes the greatest waste and customer dissatisfaction. The practice of Agile Development helps to avoid this common pitfall.<hr>

<b>Ansarul Islam Laskar</b>:  (SAD Tehnology Pvt. Ltd.) I fully support Agile Methodology and I apply the same in my working environment. The agile Methodology has helped my organization to grow rapidly with a very good fame. <hr>
<a href="mailto:Scott@RapidScrum.com">Scott Downey</a>:  (<a href="http://www.RapidScrum.com">Rapid Scrum LLC</a>) I could have sworn I signed this YEARS ago, but a recent question prompted me to confirm it.  I was shocked to find I was not listed!

To be clear:  I support everything in the Agile Manifesto (all 4 Values, and all 12 Principles), and I spend a significant amount of time with all of my clients teaching them to embody its wisdom and use it as their primary navigational tool to help them solve problems which aren&#39;t directly addressed through the explicit practices and structures of the various Agile processes and frameworks.<hr>

<b>Thomas Huguerre</b>.<td width="233"><b>Scott Turman</b>: Agile methods kept me from going to law school 6 years ago when the cantankerous nature of software development almost made me change careers. <hr>
<a href="mailto:terrence.cumberland@bankofamerica.com">Terrence Cumberland</a>: As a practioner and strict adherent to traditional project management (ie waterfall) principles over the past 16 years, I had become accustomed to the &quot;over the wall&quot; mentality of requirements being thrown to design/development resources who may not understand the motivations and essence of the requirements. The result is often improper design, development, and delivery.  With my introdiction to this methodolgy over the past few years however, I find it refreshing that there is a collaborative approach between client and development, which in turn lends itself to better satisfaction of the requirements.  The key for success is full on committent by all participants, and the resulting reduction/elimination of finger pointing and blaming.<hr>

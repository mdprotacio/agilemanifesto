        We are uncovering better ways of developing
        software by doing it and helping others do it.

Whatever methodology you want to use, I recommend to align with the agile manifesto.<hr>

<b>Gus Summers</b>:  (Agile Supply Chain Strategies) <hr>
<b>David Hájek</b>: I work as a SAP consultant for a huge company (thousands of employees). In past few months, I started comparing my working experience to articles of Martin Fowler. Detachement from customers, developers as a resource, waterfall model pitfalls... It&#39;s all present here. I&#39;m beginning to understand (I hope) what agile is all about - making software that just works. People work with software. So it&#39;s all about people and adapting to them. To do that, one needs to be experienced software enginer, but also an experienced social engineer. The red tape approach doesn&#39;t work here. It shows in our company. The question now is - do I have courage to do try and make a change? Well...
I&#39;d like to thank everyone participating to the agile movement for their bright ideas and will to do go the right way, not the easiest. Thanks.<hr>

<a href="mailto:onevikas@gmail.com">Vikas Sharma</a>:  (<a href="http://my.rovebook.com">BITS Pilani- MSSS</a>) Agile is to software development what democracy is (or should be)to the political scenario. Software of the User(s), by the User(s), for the User(s).
You can substitute User for Customer, People, or any word of your liking. 
I think this is a major breakthrough and a welcome paradigm shift and I suggest that it is time now for Governments of the World to adopt this philosophy to run their respective Governments. A Government that works rather than create tons of paperwork. One that puts the people first and procedure later. One that dispenses justice rather than create monsters by following old algorithms of laws written in historical times. 

Kudos to this philosophy and I recommend expansion of it beyond just software development.

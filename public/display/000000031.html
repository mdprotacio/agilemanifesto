Since then, I joined the best Agile company in the world, and I now work with over 500 people worldwide who believe fundamentally in the values of this Manifesto.  Clearly, there is business benefit to these values, as our business is *very* successful ;-) Agile is to process model as OO is to programming model -&gt; in 5 years, almost everyone will be Agile...<hr>

I love customer collaboration and the feeling of achieving things as a team instead of the battlefield approach of hard requirements docs and 6 week change requests. <hr>
<a href="mailto:whyskp@yahoo.com">Krishna Prasad Yerramilli</a>: I read Kent Beck&#39;s articles when I was attempting to bring reality into the projects I was managing. The unfortunate fact is that customers are trained to expect nothing better. 

If the Agile Manifesto can help bring change, I would support it.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wingersoll@caseygrp.com">Bill Ingersoll</a>:  (<a href="http://www.caseygrp.com">The Casey Group</a>) I am a Director of Software Development and have worked with many various developing and management methodolgies. I have been employing Agile Methods now on a consistent basis for a few years and have achieved great sucess in delivering  projects to clients. On a few recent occasions I had to employ &quot;traditional heavy&quot; methodologies for a particuilar client and actually had more difficulty and problems in bringing the projects in. Hopefully the industry will pay more attention to the Agile Model and embrace the benefits it brings. Having actual experience, I most certainly have become a dedicated student! <hr>
<a href="mailto:gs@sepiaport.com">gisela strauss</a>:  (<a href="http://agile_webdesign.blogspot.com/">http://agile_webdesign.blogspot.com/</a>) 
As a creative knowledge worker I believe that Agile programming allows me to apply logical processes, while remaining within the creative flow. 

This will solve the inherent problem webdesign was facing from 
its onset : 
A missing framework for managing the interdependent 
nature of creative and logical development processes.

Agile methods render webdesign and development methods more effective.
And these methods in turn can be streamlined  with all-over Agile programming processes.

<b>Isaac K. Acquah</b>: Today&#39;s ever-changing industry dynamics do call for life cycle flexibility to amend business requirments later down the development path - when knowledge and understanding of both developers and clients would have significantly improved in the solution domain. The Agile method&#39;s ability to take up such late but value-add changes provides a real winner in the race for competitive advantage. What a realistic approach to today&#39;s development work!<hr>

<a href="mailto:tcoretto@pntmarketingservices.com">Tony Coretto</a>:  (<a href="http://www.pntmarketingservices.com">PNT Marketing Services, Inc.</a>) Agile software development is something my company has stressed, unknowingly, for years now; we have always believed in (1) the primacy of the user, (2) working directly with the user and showing results fast, (3) accepting change (has anyone ever really worked on a software development project where all requirements were known up front and no changes were made as the project evolved?), (4) allowing project, user, and people needs to determine team structure for best effect. We have always felt we were swimming upstream especially if we interfaced with large systems development organizations at client companies, who mostly adhere strictly to &quot;analysis/requirements/development/systems test/user test/implementation&quot; lifecycle planning, and it is refreshing and inspiring to see the agile manifesto organized as a viable and preferable alternative for better results. <hr>

But, no cost in development increase wether you use a method, expecially simple. 
I&#39;d like to promote Agile Alliance as a method to think first, and to do then.<hr>

<a href="mailto:j.delascurain@computer.org">John E. DeLascurain</a>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:pengster@pengster.com">Lim Fung Peng</a>:  (pengster.com) I am an avid believer that developers are not only robots carrying out instructions in the assembly line of development processes. I see developers as ninjas, efficient at assasinating bugs and fixing problems where no by-the-book contract can do the job. A good developer is like a nimble ninja, able to respond to the situation, collaborate with other ninja-developers to efficiently and reliably produce software that just works.
Delivering working software to customer satisfaction and doing what it takes to deliver on time has always been my goal and the goal I teach my team members.
I feel agile development to be the answer to my &quot;philosophy on development&quot; and the calling of all ninja-developers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:marvm@dimensional.com">Marv Miller</a>:  (Bridge Consulting) Having been born 3 days before Pearl Harbor and working with computers since 1959...including a 20 year stint with IBM, I&#39;ve been skirting the edges of &quot;corporate civility&quot; (not) for a long time. I avoid working for most corporations wherein I cannot wear rubber gloves during my work day at the &quot;factory&quot; (to avoid contracting &quot;the dis-ease&quot;). In other words, as a C# .NET developer with weird metaphysical interests, I mostly starve. I LOVE working on projects, with and without others. I usually leave as soon as a big ego shows up who wants to control things because...well...they&#39;re in charge. My creativity flounders in such an environment. Thanks for BE-ing HERE-n-NOW...I&#39;m happy I discovered you this day. (Thanks to Sedgewick@Nata1.com , who, I suspicion, is an agile Agiler.)<hr>
<a href="mailto:remaley@earthlink.net">Thomas Remaley</a>:  (TRAI) Agile techniques bridge the gap between customesr and developers, ensuring that the delivered systems do what the customer&#39;s need and can be readily adapted to the changing requirements of today&#39;s business environment.  Applicable to large or small systems, I&#39;ve successfully applied agile techniques to systems developments in a variety of domains.<hr>

<a href="mailto:tony@tonyventura.com">Anthony Ventura</a>:  (<a href="http://www.tonyventura.com">Ventura Web Design</a>) Hello,

I just became aware of the Agile Manifesto through a research assignment for Capella University.  I am working towards my Master&#39;s degree in System Design and Programming.  I have always felt that the customer should be integrated throughout the system development life cycle, however, after readying the Agile Manifesto, it seems that your approach goes to great lengths to insure that the customer is THE focal point of software development.

Thank you,

Anthony Ventura<hr>

&quot; To utilize the Agile methodology known as Scrum, to bring in software development projects on time and on budget giving the customer the satisfaction in getting useable software in a timely manner.&quot; <hr>

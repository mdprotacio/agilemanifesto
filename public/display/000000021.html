<a href="mailto:spam1@voxlox.com">Derek Wade</a>: &quot;Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential...&quot; Right on!

The physical definition of &quot;work&quot; is &quot;force through a distance&quot; (W = F * d).  Pushing against a problem with all your might matters little if the problem hasn&#39;t &quot;moved.&quot;  Just because effort is being expended does not mean work is being done.  Just because we&#39;re working long hours, or putting code into production, does not mean we&#39;re helping the customer, or solving our business problems.

I have always been a proponent of results over effort.  In a discussion with my former advisor, I mentioned the disparity between the goal of cranking out code vs. the goal of creating software that solves problems.  He had this quote for me:

&quot;Industrious people create industry -- lazy people create civilization.&quot;<hr>

<a href="mailto:cgruber@israfil.net">Christian Edward Gruber</a>:  (<a href="http://www.israfil.net/">Israfil Consulting Services Corporation</a>) I have lived this for over 10 years - it&#39;s a shame so few of my employers and contract holders realized it.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kontakt@hankewitz.de">Lutz Hankewitz</a>:  (<a href="http://www.hankewitz.de">HR + IT</a>) The people are the key to growth. If we treat them with high regard we find loyalty and power and in the end excellent software. <hr>

<b>Przemyslaw Skrzek</b>:  (Swiss Soft Poland) I love it! I would like to make it work in my company! Although I have tons of questions since I heard about Agile, I deeply believe it must work! We tried it for a while and the results are unbelivable. Conceptually, in 3 months we did more than last 3 years!<hr>
<a href="mailto:aperahia@netvision.net.il">Abraham Perahia</a>:  (<a href="http://www.hoq-pass.com">The House of Quality</a>) Interactions and cooperation are the best processes ever. Correctly responding to changes is the best plan possible.
Thank you for putting down clearly what we felt for a long time.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dalton@teleport.com">Michael Dalton</a>: Finally, some people who &quot;get it&quot; are forming a community of thought about what software (and product in general) development is *really* about. Count me in in any way I can contribute.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:phamk26@hotmail.com">Khoa Pham</a>:  (<a href="http://www.agilityware.com">AgilityWare</a>) I think Agile Develope will bring the business of making software into being real enineering..<hr>
<a href="mailto:jiri.lundak@acm.org">Jiri Lundak</a>:  (<a href="http://www.lundak.org">http://www.lundak.org</a>) Each and every project not conducted in the agile spirit that goes overboard in time and budget (and there are lots of those), demonstrates the validity of the agile movement&#39;s maxims. Let&#39;s work together to convince managment of this fact.<hr>
<a href="mailto:naveen@blueslate.net">Naveen Krishnaswamy</a>:  (<a href="http://www.blueslate.net">Blueslate Solutions</a>) Agile Programming &amp; Agile Testing is the way to go.

We have used Xtreme programming and found its very useful and customers love it.<hr>

<a href="mailto:svp@godrej.com">Satish Pendse</a>:  (<a href="http://www.godrejinfotech.com">Godrej Infotech Ltd.</a>) The idea sounds interesting and is indeed the need of the hour. How it takes care of issues related to CMM / ISO can be thought of. We are in fact piloting a proto-type methodology for faster SW development in our organization. With incresing interaction amongst SW developers, this idea is going to catch up fast.<hr>
<a href="mailto:gianni@one6ix.com">Gianni Jacklone</a>: A pragmatic methodology that embraces change, promotes communication, and produces quality.<hr>

<a href="mailto:suryaprakash_vk@infosys.com">surya</a>: Agile software development is a good process which removes unnecessary steps in the &quot;assembly line&quot;. The milestones during development has to be working software with incremental functionality and complexity that is developed in collaboration with customer.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Peter@Lehman.Name">Peter Lehman</a>:  (<a href="http://www.AppliedInnovationsResearch.com">Applied Innovations Research LLC</a>) Cooperative, articulate and considerate people comprise the best teams, the Agile Manifesto, like a compass, helps guide the team towards a common goal as any member can deviate in the fog of uncertainty, complexity and stress.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:michael.ganss@oo-services.com">Michael Ganss</a>:  (<a href="http://www.oo-services.com/">O&O Services GmbH, Berlin, Germany</a>) Agile methods and Extreme Programming in particular have influenced my thinking towards software developments very strongly. I believe deeply in this new approach. Before I had read &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; a couple of years ago I knew there had to be a better way than the frustrating projects I was involved then. Extreme Programming is that way.
Unfortunately, up until now I have not been lucky enough to be involved in an &quot;all XP&quot; project, although I won&#39;t stop trying with every new project. 
The biggest hurdle IMO is customers who don&#39;t have a software development background, i.e. they don&#39;t know there is such a thing as software development methods, let alone agile  methods. Going from 0 to 100 with these customers is very hard. Also it seems to me fixed scope contracts are deeply rooted in (at least German) business society.
I&#39;d like to thank the signatories of the agile manifesto for showing us a way of doing what I love with fun: developing software.
I&#39;m proud to be able to be a part of what I believe will change software development forever. Keep going.<hr>
<a href="mailto:paulsanfordfriedman@yahoo.com">Paul Friedman</a>: I wholeheartedly agree.<hr>
<b>Eric Simmerman</b>:  (<a href="http://www.tempeststrings.com/">Tempest Strings Enterprises, Inc.</a>) The best solutions are ones that upon explanation seem obvious.<hr>

Most heavy processes attempt to address these by heavily documenting the software to be built.  The problem is, most actual users are either unable or uninterested in reading and understanding heavy documentation with nuanced implications.  By better acknowledging the human element, Agile methods are the best tools I have found so far to improve the odds of success.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:tomme@live.co.uk">Tom De Raedt</a>:  (Freelance consultant) In an ever-changing world of complex business processes, the software to support this becomes more important every second. As does the required budget to realize this.
In many cases, decision makers, already under budget pressure, don’t realize sufficiently that software is more complex than meets the eye. The usage of agile methods imploring the need for writing unit tests is, in addition to a seemingly already too expensive development, often considered as ‘intellectual masturbation’ of the development team.
Fortunately, I feel change coming. A change that I can embrace ;)<hr>
<b>Ahmed-Omar</b>:  (<a href="http://ahmedsleem.blogspot.com">LINKdotNET</a>) Be Agile,
If you are not agile.

You Diffenitly Lose alot of things.

Agile Can Change your Live.

But either you Can see That Cup as what you need (Just enogh)<hr>
<a href="mailto:marioaiello@bluewin.ch">Mario Aiello</a>: I&#39;ve been working on why projects fail for the past 3 years without finding a solution to issues on communication, planning, change management, risk management, etc., which are at the core of project failure. Mi first experience with Agile methodologies was 2 years ago managing BPM Pegasystems PRPC development. All projects that I&#39;ve seen completed were nothing less than succcess and the issues I was so concerned with before seem to be non isues at present. As a project manager I&#39;m engaged to make the change to servant leadership in agile project management and support the agile philosophy because I firmly believe that it&#39;s a way to reduce failure in software development projects.<hr>

All of us should follow the manifesto for optimizing the management of SCRUM projects based on a long term solution with short term development work taking care of scenarios and actors (see: refactoring).

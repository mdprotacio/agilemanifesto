In the 21st Century, Design IS Communication. Agile helps you get there faster, at lower cost, and with far better results in both the short- and long-term. This is a ringing endorsement, and as such, I suggest that we all answer the call.<hr>
<b>Domagoj Mohl</b>: In past 10 Years I used the agile methods whenever I could, I used all my energy to implement and support agile methods. My experience is that the agile method is the best method to develop the solutions for customers. <hr>

<b>Jason Rice</b>:  (Johns Hopkins University) I wholeheartedly endorse the Agile Manifesto. The USG and JHU are currently employed Agile methodologies and practices. These principles are revolutionizing the engineering of software and it is my sincerest hope that these practices shall continue to be upheld and adhered to.<hr>
<b>Nicholas Eayrs</b>: Bring back the fun! I&#39;m proud to support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<a href="mailto:mynetsky@gmail.com">Anthony Sejas</a>:  (Founder of Baulen Spain) I deeply believe in Collaboration over Competition.
Helping people over earning money.
Sharing knowledge over being the wisest.
Because the behavior of Collaboration, Help, Share and Love is the same that digital data.
When you give them, you are multiplying them. You don&#39;t lose anything and instead you receive more.<hr>

<b>Jane McConnell</b>.<hr>
<b>Colm Clinton</b>:  (BPP Professional Education) Agile supports the project I have delivered in fast paced organisations by accommodating change; in circumstances when direction is unclear - the delivery of demos and working technology, in iterations, is a huge benefit.<hr>
<b>Marc Seery</b>.<hr>
<b>Lawrence Billy-Eko</b>: Having used ISO, CMMI, RUP and other hybrid methodologies in the past, I am sold on the Agile way !!!<hr>

<b>Jorge Alberto Pérez Torres</b>:  (Allianz México) I have spent at least 10 years spreading this manifesto and, even if we are not always able to apply it, we never have to forget the fact of providing value is above the rest of issues. <hr>
<b>Piotr Retmańczyk</b>: Being young developer is hard. It is necessary to have really huge willingness to do your job in the right way. You have to learn a lot how to write professional code besides keeping in your mind all good standards of being part of the team,how to prepare architecture solutions, how to test your solutions etc. But it would be a lot harder without Agile Manifesto. Becoming professional some day would not happen without Agile Manifesto. When you have written all those wonderful standards I was 10 years old. After next 15 years your Manifesto is still present and I am really happy that I have possibility to learn from it at the start of my career. Thank you a lot.<hr>

Every point of manifesto has so much importance which if given a thought can be a game changer for all.<hr>
<a href="mailto:arglove@gmail.com">Andrew Glover</a>: I have lived in organizations that fight agile as much as they can.  At the end of the day, when something really needs to get done and get done right, they let me go agile!  I personally compare Agile to the ability to slam dunk a basketball.  Some just naturally glide through the air.  Some can do it, but with a lot of focused training in the gym to improve their jumping ability.  Others will never put it together and make all these reasons why shooting from 10 feet out is really the way to go.  So, put in a good training program, recognize when someone just isn&#39;t able to jump and don&#39;t let anyone lower the hoop or accept that its ok to just shoot from 10 feet out.<hr>
<b>Richard Manky</b>.<hr>
<b>Bruno Rafael Sant Ana</b>: I don&#39;t want to oversimplify what Agile means, but I think we could synthesise it with the statement &quot;deliver valuable software continuously, doing this backed by great software engineering practices&quot;. I&#39;m proud in supporting Agile because Its essence is what was missing in the software world.<hr>
<b>Michael Gorriz</b>:  (Standard Chartered Bank) For us in the financial industry it is paramount to move fast to satisfy the increasing requirements of our customers. For more and more areas within a bank agile software development methods are better suited than waterfall methods.<hr>

<b>Irek Szukiewicz</b>:  (hewlett packard) It is right approach to do not always in software production. A lot of finance related processes die of bureaucracy and over processing, without knowing the nature of your involvement in the process or a project....</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000373.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

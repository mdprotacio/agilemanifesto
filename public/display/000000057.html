I am trained &amp; certified in RUP. However, I have neither executed nor was in any team that executed projects using agile methodology. I believe Agile philosophy is more natural in more ways than one. I am interested in collaborating with other &#39;agile&#39; individuals &amp; groups to experiment, analyze and further the cause of Agile community.

Hail Agile!

<a href="mailto:joey.mullen@gmail.com">Joey Mullen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.iehinc.com">Molecular Epidemology Inc.</a>) The Agile Manifesto embodies the guiding principles that have used for successful software development for more than 20 years.
Through movements such as this, the future of software development seems bright, fun, and exciting.  It is great to start breaking down the stereotypes of a developer going through the black hole with the customers wondering if they will ever emerge again, and when they do, emerging from the other side with software that is broken, outdated, and doesn&#39;t fit the need anymore.<hr>

<a href="mailto:niket.etambe@gmail.com">Niket Etambe</a>: The Agile Manifesto truly provides the fundamentals for building enterprise solutions crucial for ensuring  business stability, enhancement and continuity by encouraging a collaborative thought-process through out - from visioning through deployment. Personally, I feel that Agile Software Development Manifesto provides the right approach to address issues pertinent to design and implementation of highly accurate enterprise-wide solutions<hr>

<a href="mailto:mfabus@sbcglobal.net">Fabus</a>: Harmony combines tone, balance, interval, frequency, relative scale, and natural sustain. Blend is the collective signature that produces identity and dynamic intensity. Great teams are like perfectly struck chords. In tune, clear, simple, absolute and beautiful. <hr>

Sankara Narayanan</a>:  (<a href="http://www.stsociety.org">STSociety.org</a>) The next generation software development process is nothing but the Agile Process. I somehow feel that this Agile Process has very much close relationship with Context Sensitive Development Process. Anyhow, that is debatable...<hr>

<b>Jussi Hannunen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.tamk.fi">Tampere Polytechnic</a>) To me, Agile development is about knowing the rules well enough to forget them. This allows me to concentrate on understanding the problem at hand.<hr>

<b>Hashim Abbasi</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ekalsoft.com">Kalsoft (Pvt) Ltd.</a>) We have been following a philosophy that is clearly related to the Agile software development. Since my team is involved in product development where we are the customers and the developers and requirements come from within. Following the formal SDLC life cycle, there is no way we can adjust new features such late in the development process without cost over runs. <hr>

I am really interested in implementation of agile methodology in my projects i find its really great.

Thanks

<a href="mailto:pkalmijn@xs4all.nl">Peter Kalmijn</a>:  (<a href="http://www.logicacmg.nl">LogicaCMG</a>) I learned to value Agile principles and techniques during my career as ProjectManager, Software Architect, Systems Engineer and TestManager. The principles are easyly integrated and flexibly combined with established Methods like Prince2, DSDM, TestManagement (LogicaCMG), RUP, etc.
And it does combine really well with NLP which I use every day working with people and organisations.

<b>Robert Norton</b>:  (<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/Norton,+Robert.html">ThoughtWorks</a>) Craig Larman has likened the acceptance of agile methods to the Copernican Revolution in terms of adoptance patterns and importance. Trying to build software that needs to readily adapt in a plan and process-driven environment is simply primitive and misguided. Here&#39;s to a heliocentric software universe! <hr>

Finally bringing software development out of engineering or conveyor-belt thinking.  Convincing management is another story however.  Good luck everyone.<hr>

<a href="mailto:tinkerc@gmail.com">Chris Tinker</a>:  (Magic Enterprises.Biz Limited) I am a Project Director (Siemens trained) now running my own business providing Business Analysis and Project Management services to the European Union. As an SSADM, DSDM, Chestra, PMI BOK and Prince 2 practitioner, I have been battling against the paper trail of Prince 2 methodology for some years. AGILE provides my business with a great new approach to fast track and quality development.
Well done, I will certainly get my company to join the AGILE Consortium ASAP!<hr>
<a href="mailto:Clark.Wise@valpo.edu">Clark Wise</a>: It just makes sense.  Why should things have ever been any other way?<hr>
<b>Jaime Agudo</b>:  (<a href="http://www.jaimeagudo.com">Terra Networks, as signed in 2006</a>) I&#39;ve been an agile developer for all my life, even without knowing it!

Developing applications for the internet and managing teams of developers since 1996 has made me realize this is the only way to do it in the fast-evolving constant-changing internet applications world.

Finding this manifesto and all the people who support it proves that we are not alone.<hr>

As such the only savior for the brave are the Agile methods.  In my view, Agile techniques focus on work and product optimization rather than useless loquacity about processes.<hr>

<b>Bryan Wilcutt, BsCS, MsMS, PMP</b>: Non-agile methodologies do have their place in the world, as does ADA, however their scope have become increasingly afixed to governmental projects.  It is easy to predict that non-agile methods will be as common as ADA is within the next 10 years.

Engineering sits between Art and Science.  Agile methodologies help bring out the artist in the engineer, while satisfying the rigidness of industry. <hr>
<a href="mailto:codedigestion@hotmail.com">Shree Mulay</a>:  (<a href="http://codedigestion.wordpress.com">Radiance</a>) Well, I&#39;m new to this, but this is clearly the best approach to actually successfully building anything worthwhile in the software industry.  This is clear to me.  But, there seems to be a steep learning curve if you&#39;re trying to pick up all of this on your own in terms of setting up automation systems, unit testing practices, and a control versioning system.  Nonetheless, I am motivated to doing things the right way in the first place - Any other way would be stupid.<hr>

<a href="mailto:lalitmittal17@yahoo.com">Lalit Mittal</a>: I am working under Agile Software Development from last 3 years. I found it interesting for the start but now i can see the drawbacks as well. It requires competent staff to start with and may not suitable for larger projects. Moreover, Lack of structure and necessary documentation criticize it. But on other hand, I support its manifesto because of value it provides to the developed product.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tinyzoo@yahoo.com">Laurene Wells</a>:  (<a href="http://www.visionsgame.com">Heaven's Blessings Tiny Zoo</a>) I was talking to a friend of mine about some development and documentation issues we&#39;ve been facing on my volunteer game development team, and he shared the link to the Agile Manifesto with me.  As I was reading this, a little voice inside me started to explode with joy &quot;YES! Someone with authority who understands!&quot; I am so happy to see that there is valid evidence for a better way!  All this documentation some of my team members are wanting is smothering the life out of the project.  I want to get back to actually making games, not writing docs.  THANK YOU!

Right people, with open mind are extremely important. Learned that not every one can work in this environment, do not compromise, hire the right developers and not the &quot;paper pushers&quot; and complainers. <hr>

<a href="mailto:dhanya@dhanyakumar.com">Dhanya Kumar KV</a>:  (<a href="http://dhanyakumar.com">Valtech India</a>) Why I Like Agile Methodologies:

1. SCRUM : Avoids micromanagement. Team members   build trust and respect by doing what they said in SCRUM. It improves team bonding and helps to work collectively towards Iteration SUCCESS.

2. Retrospective: Always welcomes ideas for betterment, by identifying what went wrong in the iteration and what needs to be improved in the next iterations.

3. Artifacts : Iteration and Product backlog are so simple that any one can easily maintain it. Shows correct progress through the GRAPH/CHART. 

4. Responding to change : Adding new features after completing the product. Great threat for side effects. With small iteration, new features can be easily plugged and requires less time for testing the application.

People : People makes the difference not the process. If every individuals works with high passion to deliver good quality, then any process will gives a SUCCESS and CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.<hr>
<a href="mailto:abhiijain@yahoo.com">Abhishek Jain</a>: Agile is the way to go in today&#39;s world where software development is become more adaptive and not so much as wait and watch-and-do-it-in-sequence.<hr>
<b>Oscar Centeno</b>:  (<a href="http://great-code.blogspot.com">http://great-code.blogspot.com</a>) I find it more interesting, rewarding and fun to develop software when you apply agile principles. Greetings from Costa Rica!<hr>
<a href="mailto:ssevalkar@hotmail.com">Shrikant Sevalkar</a>: I support the agile manifesto, since it does not claim perfection as an end goal, which by the way is a theoretical construct, is prescriptive  by nature and tends to subdue human creativity, intellectual freedom and growth. 

Instead I subscribe to agile principles which offers freedom and infinite value to commerce by utilizing human organizations that are self sustained by intellectual challenge and collaborative growth in understanding. <hr>

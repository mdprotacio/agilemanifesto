To build software faster we need to *do* less. This implies smaller sets of artifacts and more effective automation. Agile processes are therefore essential to the universal goal of building better software faster, which is why this manifesto has my full support.<hr>
<a href="mailto:petermesservy@opusmagnum.com">Peter Messervy</a>:  (<a href="http://opusmagnum.com">Opus Magnum Inc.</a>) I have been pursuing most of the Agile concepts from a time before I even heard of Agile. I heartily embrace the principles and the process.

I have focused on analysis (requirements) and design practices that fit very well into the Agile philosophy. Including some modeling approaches that are very agile.<hr>
<a href="mailto:namkyu_cho@hotmail.com">Namkyu Cho</a>:  (Independent Consultant) I believe it support the compatibility with WinWin. Sure, I love the agile method.<hr>
<a href="mailto:david@buro9.com">David Kitchen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.buro9.com/">Büro 9</a>) I&#39;ve evolved into Agile Modeling through years of frustration through the development processes and restrictive practices that I&#39;ve followed within corporations. Since applying what I held to be my own &#39;philosophies of development&#39; I&#39;ve seen dramatic improvement in code and the use of the code... actually seeing projects go live and get used heavily, rather than shelved for not fitting requirements. Only later did I realise that my own philosophies were but a poor image of Agile Modeling, and since then the improvements made have been substantial. I would urge all who are interested in actually producing meaningful applications and the right solution to a problem to investigate further.<hr>

<a href="mailto:david.green@baesystems.com">David Green</a>: I develop software for military projects.  The pile of unwanted, but contracted documentation is incredible and at very high cost.  It&#39;s easy to forget that we are developing a software product.
Agile principles also seem more environmentally friendly.<hr>

<a href="mailto:b@redhooksolutions.com">Bryan Zarnett</a>:  (<a href="http://www.redhooksolutions.com/">Redhook Solutions</a>) The Agile Alliance, the Agile Manifesto and the concept of Agile methodologies, regardless of the style provides a philosophy where we can build systems and services that transform the manner in which business is done in an effective and timely manner. 

Several years ago I told my boss (old one) that I did not like the way things where done - the way we communicate with the customer, the way we develope. I said I wanted to change this. He said it could not be done. I guess we are proving him wrong!<hr>

<a href="mailto:hari@raven-bear.com">Hari Mailvaganam</a>: In all the 15+ years I have been in software development, I have not seen a more common-sense software development startegy as the Agile Software Development process.

We have been using Agile with RUP on larger projects. Most of our clients and development partners have bought into the agile process - expecially clients, when they see greater continous feedback in the development chain. Development partners are particularly interested in the &quot;change management&quot; process.

Best wishes on you next projects - e-mail me if you have any questions or would like to discuss.   <hr>
<a href="mailto:David.Larsson@tietoenator.com">David Larsson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.masterit.se">Tietoentator DevCon</a>) I agree with everything you have written.

<b>Paul Holser</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:abdullah.kauchali@isanusi.com">Abdullah Kauchali</a>:  (<a href="http://www.isanusi.com">iSanusi Systems Architects (South Africa)</a>) Software development, like many &quot;life&quot; projects is about managing complexity.  The Agile Manifesto is about braving complexity.

A couple of weeks ago, I with a group of friends completed a 5-day backpacking trail through the Fish River Canyon in Namibia.  As rookies to this daunting trail, we sought advice from a group that had done the same trail 5 times and who were starting the trail at the same time.  They asked us what our &quot;strategy&quot; was.  Our reply: shrugging shoulders and saying &quot;taking it a day at a time?&quot;.  Silently smiling, they assumed impending doom!  The experienced group had even planned exactly where they would camp each night!  We hadn&#39;t thought further than the first night.

The Fish River Canyon trail is beautiful, dynamic, ruthless and unforgiving. Planning anything to the &quot;T&quot; is futile. Tempratures can plummet or soar depending on several factors.  Carry too much, and you may suffer under your burden.  Carry too little, you suffer at the hands of the elements. Any-which-way, you can easily make a beautiful hike into a sordid experience.

We took it a day at a time.  When it rained, we made a makeshit tent with whatever we had.  It kept us dry. The contraption was dismantled the next morning.  No one carried anything superfluous.  We stuck in as a team and made the most of what we had.  We moved lightly and swiftly, taking it a day at a time.  A boulder at a time.  A river crossing at a time.  But we never lost sight of the awesome beauty of the Canyon nor lost track of the precious map leading us to our eventual destination at Ai Ais hot springs.

We made it before the other group and in &quot;one piece&quot;.  Us the rookies.  Us without our strategy - without our cut T&#39;s and dotted I&#39;s.  Us the Agile Manifesto boulder hoppers!<hr>
<b>David Taylor</b>:  (<a href="http://www.telnetmedia.com/">Telnet Media Ltd</a>) Our small team of dedicated individuals lives and breathes agile software developement. The strength of our products is based in our ability to change and follow customer needs.

We keep adding features but the code actually ends up smaller and faster everytime as the developers become increasingly skilled and extend their creativity. The freedom to dream up code powers the team along, and leaves regular progroids in the dust.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jpassouv@noos.fr">jean-paul assouvie</a>: I am a french developer ever struggling to have software made in the best way for the best usage.
And so happy to join AgileAlliance.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sander.nagtegaal@wanadoo.nl">Sander M. Nagtegaal</a>: I work in the Internet Industry, and I have found that agile methods are unavoidable when it comes to building web apps within a certain deadline.

Web software is in a continual prototyping process - user feedback and design demands are much more prevalent than in their traditional counterparts.

As a result of this dependence on emotion (because that is what it is), web functionality can hardly be planned for, deadlines are neglected, budgets are overestimated and results do not fit the needs of a client: this sounds like an average Internet project.

To protect from this, we must embrace adaptivity over predictivity!<hr>
<b>Edward Averill</b>:  (<a href="http://www.woolyloach.com">Wooly Loach Productions</a>) At last, an approach that matches my experience in software development!  If only we had this ten years ago...<hr>
<b>John Mirk</b>:  (<a href="http://ipnea.ericsson.se/r&d/product_mgmt/index.shtml">Ericsson Datacom</a>) What a breath of fresh air!  After having seen a thriving software development team (once known as &quot;Advanced Computer Communications -- ACC&quot;) taken over by a large process-oriented corporation, it is a great pleasure to see a manifesto which is a compilation of the things I enjoy most about software development.<hr>

<a href="mailto:robert.olson@us.benfieldgroup.com">Robert Olson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.benfieldgroup.com">Benfield Blanch</a>) I have always believed in the concepts in this manifesto over the objections of many consultants and auditors.  The proof is in the results and the happy users, not in the amount of documentation you produce.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:js_agman@blackrocksoftware.com">Jason Swartz</a>:  (<a href="http://www.blackrocksoftware.com">Black Rock Software</a>) This is a wonderful step forward for our field of software engineering, bravo to the authors. I&#39;ve been promoting the use of lengthy, up-front requirements analysis for software development projects for years, even as a dot-commer, and spent too much effort holding design meetings, perfecting the specs, and persuading others to actually read them. Now I can dismount my high horse and get some work done! <hr>
<a href="mailto:pc@synspace.com">Dr. Pierre Castori</a>:  (SynSpace SA) Looks like minds are gently starting to change... This is good news!<hr>
<a href="mailto:dave.rooney@mayford.ca">Dave Rooney</a>:  (<a href="http://www.mayford.ca">Mayford Technologies</a>) I have, more or less, worked according to the principles of the Agile Manifesto for my entire professional career.  It is the times that I could not follow the principles that my work (and the projects) suffered.<hr>

<b>LTC Bill Robinson</b>:  (US Army) Although, we haven&#39;t called it Agile we have been using the principles of agile sw development for several years in developing a personnel system for the Army.  We have delivered and continue to deliver a great system to our 4000+ users.  I&#39;m glad there is now a name for the approach we use for development.  The establishment usually refers to our team as the &quot;rogue&quot; developers and they think our success is accidental.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:xexeo@ufrj.br">Geraldo Xexéo</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cos.ufrj.br/~bd">Computing and System Engineering Department/UFRJ</a>) I&#39;ve been involved with software development in real life and software engineering in academics for more than 10 years and the Agile Manifesto is just what was missing.<hr>
<a href="mailto:rekharaghu@yahoo.com">Rekha Raghu</a>:  (Motorola) I couldnt agree more. Agile Development is the future of software development!<hr>
<a href="mailto:tony.kehoe@virgin.net">Tony Kehoe</a>:  (CTO - Deutsche Bank AG) At long last an approach most of us have known all along (and would have preferred to practice) as the optimum approach to delivering to our customers! It complements the demands and ever changing world of Investment Banking. The customers (Traders) prefer the transparent and dynamic interaction and of course most importantly they get what they want.<hr>

<a href="mailto:shashi@tajtech.com">Shashi Rao</a>:  (<a href="http://www.tajtech.com">TAJ Technologies, Inc.</a>) I sincerely endorse the Agile Manifesto, simply for the following reasons:


- Change in software development is inevitable. Rather than avoiding, we should plan for it.


- Software Development cycles are getting smaller and need constant management of expectations. Incremental reviews of the deliverable in the form of a prototype or preview is essential.


- Ongoing emphasis on quality improvement is a given. <hr>

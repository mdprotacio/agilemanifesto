<b>Michael Smith</b>:  (<a href="http://www.easydfe.co.uk">DFE Software Ltd.</a>) Agile methods allow me to respond to customers ever-changing requests in a pleasant way because I expect each improvement to lead to requests for further enhancements and encourage my clients to look for ways to make me a better designer, programmer and business partner.<hr>

<b>Tim Edlund</b>:  (<a href="http://www.softworksgroup.com">Softworks Group Inc.</a>) The Agile Manifesto is a foundation for true professionalism in software development and management of software projects. Putting the customer first, embracing change, respecting the judgement of the team doing the work to self-organize, and relying on interpersonal communication over documentation are fundamental principles for success.  We  fully endorse this manifesto.<hr>
<b>Nicholas Hersh</b>:  (Stanley Black & Decker) Call it agile or not the principles expressed within the Agile Manifesto support project success and solid team and communication development and interaction.<hr>
<b>Saeeda Bukhari</b>:  (IMGROUP) I have been a promoter of Agile from the first time I read the manifesto in 2004. I am also glad to see its increasing acceptance and promotion. However despite the great volume of material on the subject I still believe that the basic principles are still the best way of understanding how to apply Agile.<hr>

<b>Rajesh Francis</b>:  (ITC) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:llyons2@cox.net">Lance Lyons</a>: The Agile Manifesto is a very beneficial set of principles and guidelines 
for delivering high quality software to customers. 
      
      A couple of points to stress (even though they have already been stressed) 
      
      1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools does not been to 
disregard processes and tools.   Processes and tools help make things repeatable 
and reproduceable.  It means dont let the process cause you to do the wrong 
things.  Fix the process. 
      
      2. Responding to change over following a plan does not mean you dont need 
a plan.   You still need a plan but if the plan is not adaptable to the changing 
requirements then the plan should be adjusted.  You still need a plan and need 
to follow the plan. 
      
      
Thanks for the Agile Manifesto.

<b>Ariel Jakobovits</b>:  (Self) I am seeing agile work, so I am a believer. Values-driven development produces results. Teams can always improve their implementation of agile, but doing it halfway won&#39;t produce results. Development has always been fun, but it has become a passion to perfect my execution. Working on a software team comprised of individuals who share these values enables us to operate in top form while enjoying ourselves. Thank you for the effort to make this movement happen.<hr>

<a href="mailto:laura.pulido.diaz@gmail.com">Laura Pulido Díaz</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sidecolombia.com.cc">Sidecolombia</a>) The agile manifesto is base for my working method. I truly belive in these principle and i think the most effective way to understand and apply them on a development team is through a development methodology with steps inclusive measurement and use of usability principles to be taken as a basis for setting collaboration with the client beyond any list of requirements.<hr>

<a href="mailto:s.quiniou@rsd.com">Serge Quiniou</a>:  (<a href="http://www.rsd.com">RSD</a>) I worked for many years in development area, leading teams. I switched to Product Management in 2008.

Earlier this year, I attended SCRUM training and we adopted this methodology.

Live is different: no more long requirements document; product functionality better fitting market and customer needs.

Agile Software Development is not the future; it should be the Present for any software development team.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:vijayakumar.g@lntinfotech.com">Vijayakumar G. PMP</a>:  (L&T Infotech) I attended the CSM training (without much expectation) in 2008 just because of client&#39;s decision to adopt agile methodology. Working for 3 years in Agile, I am now a true believer of agile manifesto. The agile principles not just helped me deliver what customer (Project) expected but also to focus, organize and prioritize our work made me a better team member.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wecanhelp@wiredworx.co.uk">Robert Young</a>:  (<a href="http://www.wiredworx.co.uk">http://www.wiredworx.co.uk</a>) Agilemanifesto.org is still my favourite link to send whilst talking to customers who believe they have adopted agile but are consistently breaking the 4 fundamental principles. You are not agile because you say you are and have stand ups! :)<hr>

<b>Dan Woodward</b>:  (<a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/deedubbleyoo">http://uk.linkedin.com/in/deedubbleyoo</a>) Agile is not just a way of doing things - it is a state of mind, and a way of acting as a professional that has integrity to your colleagues and customers.<hr>

<a href="mailto:lance.dacy@dfwscrum.com">Lance Dacy</a>:  (<a href="http://www.fellowshipone.com">Fellowship Technologies (Active Network)</a>) The art of software development is complex and risky, we all know that. The gentlemen who had the courage to say &quot;something is not working&quot; started a movement with Agile and they continue to support the community at large. For that, I say they have made the lives of many developers and organizations much better and they continue to refine the process. Thank you!<hr>

<a href="mailto:dermott@126.com">Joseph Yao</a>.<hr>
<b>Roberto Acerbis</b>:  (<a href="http://www.webratio.com">WebRatio</a>) Concentrate your resources on customer&#39;s needs, capture requirements in abstract models and generate the customer&#39;s applications automatically. 

Let the functional analysts work together with designers and developers by checking realistic prototypes generated at any time, thus they can immediately verify the compliance of the work to the initial requirements.

That&#39;s the way I work since 2001, that&#39;s why I endorse Agile Manifesto.</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000218.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

<a href="mailto:john.mcadams@state.or.us">John McAdams</a>:  (<a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/technology/about_us.shtml">State of Oregon, DHS-OIS-AMS</a>) We started using Agile development methodologies in late 2005 transitioning from a full waterfall process. As a team lead, I love it! My developers love it. However, management is still (in late 2007) trying to grasp the full meaning of agile and how it fits in with a government agency.  We will get there!<hr>

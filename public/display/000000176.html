Dynamic industry needs dynamic tools to encounter the changing demands, there agile testing fits in well.<hr>

<a href="mailto:teancum34@gmail.com">Jerry Chadwick</a>: I have worked in agile shops for the better part of a decade.  Recently, I became involved in a project for a very large, Fortune 100 company that has a long history of serial/waterfall process.  They very much prefer &quot;processes and tools&quot; over &quot;individuals and interactions.&quot;  We just went through a three month, intense planning session that culminated in a week-long intense (15 hour days) high-level design and project-planning session.  These massive documents they will present to the board of directors for the company for approval and funding.  

We are trying to introduce the agile process to this company, but it is very difficult.  They are very steeped in waterfall and process.  It&#39;s very frustrating, but it&#39;s a great reminder of why I&#39;m in love with agile.

If you&#39;re investigating agile, go for it!  If you&#39;re not, you&#39;d better plan to, or you will fail.  Gartner Group says, if you don&#39;t do agile, you will die.

Happy coding!<hr>

I wholeheartedly endorse it. It&#39;s one of the best and most effective ways to design systems. I strongly recommend it to any project manager in both, IT and non-IT endeavors. <hr>

<a href="mailto:bino75@gmail.com">Bino Manjasseril</a>:  (Flagstar Bank) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:edwin.jacques@gmail.com">Edwin Jacques</a>: The information technology industry is lumbering forward, though it is still dogged by the software development life cycle practices of yesteryear.  Because IT is so critical to so many, it&#39;s easy for IT professionals to become arrogant, and disregard the customers&#39; needs.  However, the greatest success of our customers and ourselves will come from close collaboration on requirements and responding to change quickly.  As we continue to elevate the level of abstraction in our science, making something a customer can interact with quickly is paramount to providing clarity and concreteness to our dialogue.  The Agile movement is gaining critical mass, but we have quite a way to go.  No matter the state of the economy, the most agile amongst us will survive and even thrive.  Thank you to the authors of the Agile Manifesto, for giving words to the heartfelt desires of customer-driven developers.  I get it, and I will do all I can to help others to get it too.<hr>

As a Certified ScrumMaster, these are the principal&#39;s I live by. 

As a Project Management Professional, I encourage, mentor, and coach PMP&#39;s in their transition to Agile and &quot;deprogramming&quot;.<hr>

If we lean on benefitting the client, Agile software development methodology get merit, developers get the freedom to be human again, but hey, somebody&#39;s got to fund that scenario. If you are a big company or organization, there are pros and cons, the company gets to keep the client and developers for keeping them happy, but they get to pay for the accomodation of adjustment and being flexible to keep up with the standards of agile. On the other hand, if you are a Garage one man Developer, the hits are on you, you extend flexibility in the expense of your own pocket just to keep your client for making them happy. Does that mean Agile is not for the one-man developer? I guess its a matter of priorities and investment. 

But nonetheless, Agile Methodology is client based and is very down to earth. It makes Software Development much faster and highle effective for incorporating the Development Team and Client Collaboration.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rjm@zenucom.com">Rick Marshall</a>:  (<a href="http://www.zenucom.com">Zenucom Pty Ltd</a>) I&#39;ve been working this way for 30 years and would not swap it for other techniques.

The tools I build all support this as the correct way to build software.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is the only successful way to build large complex systems: small manageable pieces using these principles. One successful piece at a time.<hr>
<b>Christophe Deniaud</b>: I just truly believe in this way of working.<hr>

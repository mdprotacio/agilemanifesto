We worked as interal IT department in internatinal SAP projects in small teams with fast desiscion making (esp. with scandinavians).
Insufficient requirement description, changing requirements during realization phase but also own ideas were ongoing circumstances in all projects. Thankx.<hr>
<b>Kostas Symeonidis</b>:  (<a href="http://www.cylog.org/">http://www.cylog.org/</a>) Agree on every single point! I&#39;ve been following these principles for over 15 years and had the happiest customers on earth.
Congratulations on collecting, organising and  publishing these thoughts on the web. Thank you.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sal.novin@linnaeusinc.com">Sal Novin</a>:  (<a href="http://www.linnaeusinc.com">Linnaeus Inc.</a>) As a developer, I have always used agile development philosophy to success.  The challenge was always getting management to let go of their false sense of security - Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation.

Now,as a CEO, I find the challenge has shifted to Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation; the security blanket has become a comprehensive documentation in a legal form.  

One last note, the irony (that must be fought), is the buzz word of &quot;agile development&quot; becoming en vogue to say, but a  loss of understanding of the principles that it espouses.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:andraly_ng@yahoo.com">Andraly Ng</a>: The effectiveness of face-to-face interaction is obviously the most valuable principle to software development success.<hr>

<a href="mailto:c_sidhu@operamail.com">C.SRIDHAR</a>: After all customer is the king. I&#39;m not against other models of S/w development/management though but the amount of effort spent on documentation instead of the product or application which the CUSTOMER is interested in is humongous and he has to pay for it.
If you think as an organization then you might want to showcase yourself as CMMI-x compliant and which involves heavy documentation but as a customer it hardly provides any value.
But unfortunately today it is assumed that more the process you follow more successful you are.<hr>

<b>Luca</b>:  (<a href="http://yeahnowow.com">http://yeahnowow.com</a>) <td width="233"><b>Kevin Ortman</b>:  (<a href="http://wazu-group.org">Technology Today, LLC</a>) Although I&#39;m an American citizen, I worked in the IT industry in Japan from 1999 to 2007; first at Microsoft and then at a Japanese venture capital software vendor.  Many of the common practices I encountered while in Japan (small self-organized teams, daily stand-up meetings, intensive software development cycles with short durations, etc) were extremely productive.  Upon returning to the US, I was absolutely thrilled to find an agile revolution taking place here.  From what I&#39;ve been able to ascertain, the agile methodology borrows aspects of the Japanese team management culture but adds a level of flexibility and ingenuity that is unique to western business cultures.  This is a POWERFUL combination! <hr>

<a href="mailto:joaquim.torres@locaweb.com.br">Joca Torres</a>:  (<a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br">LocaWeb</a>) Agile Software Development brought great improvement not only to the software delivery speed and quality but also to development team motivation.<hr>
<a href="mailto:texas_rodg@yahoo.com">Rodger Luck</a>:  (Lockheed Martin) I&#39;ve used this methodology since I started coding OLTP systems in the 80&#39;s, although we didn&#39;t have a sexy acronym back then. My main reason for doing it this way was that I worked independently and my clients had little patience for paperwork in lieu of functional software. It works!<hr>
<b>Paul Bartlett</b>:  (<a href="http://www.infoqss.com">IQ Software</a>) The best methodolgies are natural and fit in the way we work.  They do not get in the way, but help a team work together well.  Regular releases are essential today, in the Internet age, and customer regular feedback and reorientation is critical.<hr>
<b>Alfred Wheeler</b>: It seems so obvious that I am surprised a manifesto is even needed.<hr>

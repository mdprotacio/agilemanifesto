<b>Danny Crone</b>:  (<a href="http://www.nfocus.co.uk">nFocus Testing</a>) agility is part of my way of life, both working and personal. From a software perspective, I believe that agility allows us to deal with complex software products and solutions.<hr>

<b>Sandeep Adinarayana</b>: The agile manifesto is my &quot;Holy Grail&quot; when it comes to software development. IMO these values and principles can be applied to many walks of life and not just software development. I have learnt a lot from the agile manifesto and I continue to get inspired. Thank You!<hr>
<b>Tim Oliver</b>: Large organisations, in my experience, can be slow to embrace necessary change and respond to new opportunities. Agile, if applied correctly, can release the chains..<hr>
<b>Sungjoon Ahn</b>: I fully support the agile manifesto. I have been working in and practicing agile for a little over a year but I totally get it.  <hr>

<b>Charles Ben Ami</b>.<hr>
<b>Pioneer Wang</b>: Revolution is required in the overall mindset for software development. Looking at Google and Facebook, they apply similar concept for their daily and rapidly moving forward development processes. 
We are seeking ways to save us from the nightmare of all the expected /unexpected reasons which cause the failure in software development. In my humble opinion, Agile, together with the right team with enough power of execution, could be the key to success in some area.   <hr>
<b>Sudhir Puligundla</b>: Being Agile is easier said than done. I believe in the Agile Manifesto and will try my best to adhere to it, learn from failures and get better in the process of delivering highest value to my customers.  <hr>

<a href="mailto:msl@netefx.com">Mark Steven Lewis</a>:  (<a href="http://www.netefx.com">NetEFX Designs</a>) I agree with the assertions in the Agile Manifesto. Some of these are reminiscent of the early days of the IETF, which says &quot;We believe in rough consensus and running code.&quot;<hr>

<b>Anish Patel</b>:  (<a href="http://codeanish.com">http://codeanish.com</a>) Being Agile, no matter what process you use is even more vital today than it has ever been in the face of ever increasing complexity. Delivering to your clients great software should be your main priority and the agile manifesto outlines the important principles that we should all adhere to.<hr>
<b>Lorenzo Pasqualis</b>: Agile development is the common sense response to software development corporate bureaucracy that afflicted, and still afflicts, sections of our industry.<hr>
<b>Richard Butler</b>:  (AT&T) Let&#39;s make it happen - be Agile!<td width="233"><b>Saabirah Desai</b>: The Agile Manifesto is a sound and roadmap to providing optimal stakeholder / customer satisfaction and making every attempt to meet organizational strategic goals. Those that not only endorse it, but also adhere to it, they too become more marketable. <hr>

<a href="mailto:danmosora@gmail.com">Dan Mosora</a>: An inspiring manifesto, indeed!<hr>
<b>Tomasz Nedzi</b>:  (<a href="http://www.skills.pl">skills sp. z o.o.</a>) I found Agile Manifesto to be confusing in 2005, but I understand now that in order to value people, products, customers and being reactive we also need to have the order in place. 

It took me couple of years to understand it properly, but I couldn&#39;t agree more.

<a href="mailto:prakharpiyush@yahoo.co.uk">Prakhar Piyush</a>:  (EPAY Systems Inc.) As a Project Manager, I always learned and practiced &quot;The Customer First&quot;. Gradually I got a project to migrate all our customers using our legacy application to newly designed application. It was a complex project which involved more than 20+ different customers with different needs and requirements. The traditional Waterfall method could have done a little to constant changing requirements of the customers and it was the right time for me to practice Agile methodology. 
I was amazed to learn that customers actually liked being a part of the Project and were highly satisfied with the Project output.

I give Agile a Thumbs Up, and will continue to practice it for all of my projects. <hr>

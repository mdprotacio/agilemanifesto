<a href="mailto:mgabreselassie@fsbpt.org">Mesfin Gabreselassie</a>:  (Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy) In my sixteen years of software development I was looking and searching for a software development methodology that embraces instead of fights change in requirements.

My only thought is that why did it take thirty decade for the software industry to come to terms with change.<hr>

<b>Vincenzo Capuano</b>.<hr>
<b>Mithun Oorath</b>.<td width="233"><b>The Dread Pirate Crom</b>:  (<a href="http://theagilepirate.net">http://theagilepirate.net</a>) I first read and agreed with the manifesto many years ago having been introduced to it by an elder sibling. I had concerns that on face-value it was too easy to misinterpret and highly developer-centric. I believe this challenge still exists as software is a means to an end in delivering business value but greater global acceptance, understanding and the hard work of agile executive coaches are getting the point across. Having worked hard to achieve an agile culture in multiple teams and organizations over the years I finally feel qualified to sign up.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dadepew@comcast.net">Doug Depew</a>:  (Logic D Consulting) Agile adoption takes time for most companies.  If you are the individual leading the Agile transmogrification of an entity, STAY THE COURSE!  Do not get derailed by the day to day resistance.  And most importantly....HAVE FUN doing it!  Watching change for the better is very rewarding.  Lastly, display the Agile Manifesto for all to see.  It&#39;s a good constant reminder.  <hr>
<b>Rui Macedo</b>: Winning through Simplicity <hr>
<b>Prashant Musale</b>: Agile Project Management equips Project Teams and Project Managers to respond to ever changing business environment in a manner which reduces waste and focuses teams on delivering things which are business critical and are of value.<hr>
<b>James Findlay</b>: As the CTO for my organisation it is critical that we deliver responsive change to the businesses and the users we serve. Agile is the way forward.<hr>

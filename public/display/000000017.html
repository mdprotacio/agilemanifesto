It must support constant integration, refactoring, and be 100% available in a way that&#39;s lighhtweight, low cost of use, and flexible.<hr>

<a href="mailto:nick@ss.com.au">Nick Zdunic</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ss.com.au">Strategic Systems</a>) This is one of the most sensible things to come through in IT.  To me this quantifies common sense - which no one ever does.  It takes the EGO out of software development through the XP techniques and the principles have been something I&#39;ve always felt but I&#39;ve never felt such a unity as this, in that it reinforces my opinions on software development.  

It encourages me to grow and disregard the baggage of bulky methodologies and EGO centric developers and lets me get to the crux of the matter and produce good well crafted software that is easy to maintain.  That&#39;s the important thing - THE CODE.

I&#39;m looking forward to growing with this movement - the positiveness I feel it is engendering has given me a new reason for being in the IT industry.<hr>

I have also set up an XP special interest group to promote and coach the adoption of XP within the software lab - hoping to prove that lightweight methodologies can be adopted in a traditionally super-formal environment.<hr>

<a href="mailto:secuserv@attbi.com">Jacob motola</a>:  (Security Services International) As an athlete agility drills were fundemental to the development and expression of athletic ability  in the context of achieving success in a specific sport. 

Agilie Software Development as interpreted from our manifesto, describes the fundementals necessary for the timely, fiscally responsible and successful development of applications for business and personal use.

ASD is a commonsensical approach to a complex and sensitive endeavor. It has a contextual appropriateness to the world and business environments we live and work in. 

I look forward to the changes and refinements yet to come.<hr>

<a href="mailto:henrik@kniberg.com">Henrik Kniberg</a>:  (<a href="http://www.kniberg.com/henrik/">http://www.kniberg.com/henrik/</a>) Over the past decade I have started several tech companies and had the opportunity to experiment with various development processes. During the past 1 - 2 years XP has been my favorite toy and so far it has worked very well, although I have not yet tried with large teams. 

However I think dogmatically sticking to any one methodology is counterproductive - in the end experience, common sense, and an open mind is what counts.

I fully agree with the principals of the agile manifesto, and I especially like the fact that is presented as a set of principals rather than a methodology.  <hr>

Our teams were approaching Agile practices, but did not know it until we found this site.  Now we have some thing to fight off the bureaucrate who keep trying to shoehorn us into a waterfall methodology.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dononelson@earthlink.net">Don Nelson</a>: Agile approaches have always intrigued me.

I&#39;m an early adopter of ZTM (Zero Time to Market) and disposable software philosophies.

I&#39;m also a proponent of agile techniques while maintaining the robustness of an architecture-driven development process.

In any successful methodology or approach to a problem, the primary requirement is initial organization - more so with agile techniques than any other.  I would like to contribute by helping to identify additional team and organization attributes that need to be identified and channeled into useful, strategic actions.

Hope I can help,

Don Nelson

It makes sense and sounds like this is the way development is conducted in any case, whatever formal methodology is being used.  I can&#39;t wait to try it!<hr>

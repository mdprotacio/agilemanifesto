<a href="mailto:dash.pradeep@gmail.com">Pradeep Dash</a>:  (IBM) After some years of experience developing, architechting and managing software development, my conclusions are according to Agile manifesto. I have seen conflicting situations in Project management between the stakeholders for areas like - identified scope, defined processes/tools etc. And if I remember the way it was handled or managed then it aligns with the Agile principle - setting your priority right and having more humanly touch (interaction within the team and stakeholders, partnership with client for development,revisiting/resetting priorities as per need and change etc) than anything else. Agile is the way forward. <hr>

<a href="mailto:jasin@theorbo.com.au">Jasin</a>:  (Theorbo ) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:dave@tavres.com">Dave Tavres</a>: I started in software in 1994 in the waterfall method. It worked, but not always well. In the past many years, as I&#39;ve experienced, learned and trained in agile methods, I&#39;ve become an agilist for life. Not just &quot;life&quot; as in time, but &quot;life&quot; as in my day-to-day world.

I love to share the idea of agile with non-software friends and family and believe that the more people understand about it, the better they&#39;ll be able to apply it to their work and lives.<hr>
<b>Steve Sether</b>: I&#39;ve been doing Agile, though not a formalized method for many years now.  I&#39;ve recently had the unfortunate experience of being put on a waterfall project (don&#39;t ask), and I&#39;ve come to realize where all the precepts of Agile come from, and the massive shortcomings of waterfall.<hr>
<a href="mailto:luca.forzano@tiscali.it">Luca Forzano</a>: I support firmly projects simplicity: customers have right to have best quality and clearness in the projects, for that reason I support Agile Manifesto (so we can work better).

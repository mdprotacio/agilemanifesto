<a href="mailto:Brian_Lucas@Compaid.com">Brian Lucas</a>:  (<a href="http://www.CompAid.com">Computer Aid, Inc.</a>) I have been working on Agile concepts before they were popularized in 2001.  Agile is an organic and natural way of developing; and in its truest sense forms and reforms itself along with its team to adapt to changing circumstances.  Under optimal circumstances, there is actually no directing or managing activity on an Agile project.  Work is identified, accepted and flows to and from the most appropriate person smoothly and naturally.  The same is true for ideas.  The productivity and the quality that results from this level of Agile are truly astounding, easily in the exponential factor range.  When the Agile concepts are applied to the organization structure as well; even more benefits are realized.  This is a frightening concept to some because it eliminates (or at least minimalizes) the need for administrative management, but it is inevitable, driven by the laws of economics.  Will Agile ever die?  No!  Agile will ALWAYS evolve.  Like genetic code, it is subject to Darwinian influences and constantly adapts to meet the needs of the enterprise.  The seed of Agile has been planted by the Agile Manifesto!  It is up to all of us now, to develop it into its full potential and utility though infinite diversity.<hr>

You will find that most of them where the team has incorporated these principles and ideals into their daily practices.
When I write this, I should not forget the effort and energy of my great colleagues David and Jeremy for putting this.<hr>

<a href="mailto:talhabmasood@gmail.com">Muhammad Talha Bin Masood</a>:  (<a href="http://www.mazars.com">Mazars</a>) I support the idea of having a standardized business analysis practice covering agile software development, as according to my experience most of the innovative and new generation software products are being built following the same methodology. This is something i found missing in the current BABOK principles and I now hope it to be there adding a must flavor and more practicality to it. As a 6 year experienced Business analysis professional I really would like to appreciate the effort.<hr>
<a href="mailto:Kingshuk.Chatterjee@skroidslab.com">Kingshuk Chatterjee</a>: I believe in the fundamental principles of Agile Development. All that I have learnt in my career till date is this that agility and flexibility is of primary importance in the world of software development. It is critical that customers or the stakeholders see the practical utility of their vision early on, so that course correction can be applied with minimal impact on budget and time. This alone makes Agile development a veritable force. <hr>

<b>Sam Sullivan</b>:  (<a href="http://www.rbc.com/">Phillips, Hager & North (RBC)</a>) I endorse the principals of the Agile Manifesto.  I&#39;ve seen them work.  I&#39;ve witnessed how swiftly individual interactions can overcome difficulties that no amount of plan and process seem to be able to.  The tight feedback loop fostered through frequent deliveries of working software and the value given to team members as empowered and accountable individuals puts pride back into software engineering.<hr>

<b>Mohd Kamal Ariffin Bin Md Kassim</b>: The Agile manifesto really make sense and a win-win scenario for all.

Client: Get their end product closer to their requirement. Adjustment is less costly and can be realised early in development. Can see a workable product quickier.

Developer: Small chunk of work, thus less pressure more creativity and more focused.<hr>

<a href="mailto:kiconnolly@aol.com">Kathleen  I Connolly</a>:  (<a href="http://www.caa.us.com">Connolly and Associates, Inc. </a>) The principles of the Agile Manifesto embrace the basics of business solution development.  Over the years, we have lost these fundamentals: 
1.Listen to the customer and our colleagues
2.Be nimble in our process 
3.Ensure OUR success achieves goal congruency with the customer and our company.  
No process is perfect, but these principles embrace a roadmap for perfection.  Thank you for framing this manifesto so well.

<b>Florian Sesser</b>:  (<a href="http://www.it-agenten.com/">IT-Agenten</a>) When I was beginning my CS studies some years ago, agile methods were still new and not on a big issue on my curriculum. I learned waterfall, funny spirals, the V model, and asked myself how anybody anywhere could produce software in time and on budget while adhering to processes that rigid. Learning about agile methods later felt natural and sane. Nothing about XP felt extreme. Now I am just glad I have been born after the time of the slow, huge process models of the past. Thank you all!<hr>

<b>Christopher Raastad</b>:  (<a href="http://fits.me">Fits.me</a>) I &lt;3 Agile!
Before TDD + Agile I could barely code or write software.  With the philosophy of Uncle Bob&#39;s Clean Code, Pivotal Tracker, collective code ownership, communicating with stake holders, and really being aggressive with TDD and BDD, I am confident in my software systems, development practices, and overall a happier more productive software craftsmen. Thanks!<hr>
<b>Andrew Cardno</b>:  (<a href="http://www.andrewcardno.com">http://www.andrewcardno.com</a>) 15 years of agile it is an amazing process/way of life.<hr>
<b>Julien T.</b>:  (<a href="http://www.tendances-de-mode.com">TDM</a>) Agility (ability and intent to adopt changes) is the key to any progress. Agile as an approach is an outside-in customer focused approach.  I both endorse and pursue these principles. <hr>
<a href="mailto:monir@bglobalsourcing.com">T.M. Moniruzzaman</a>:  (<a href="http://www.bglobalsourcing.com">bGlobalsourcing</a>) I have been working in software development areas for more than 12 years and recently implemented Agile Methodology (about a year ago). I must say, Agile Methodology is the most innovative way to manage development structure in practice since I’m getting good response amongst the team and getting better performance in regard to the environment, effectiveness and efficiency. I love to follow continuously along with this path!<hr>

<a href="mailto:stevepeha@ttms.org">Steve</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ttms.org">Teaching That Makes Sense, Inc.</a>) Not only have I grown in my work as a technologist through Agile principles but Agile has become a foundational element in the education reform work that I do around the country.

Agile is a great software methodology. But it seems to have so many applications beyond software. It is a natural fit for education. And I&#39;ve written about this and spoken about it several times with great success.

I think the Manifesto, the Principles, and the greater Agile community have made, and will continue to make, extraordinary contributions to the world of work--and to the world itself.<hr>

<a href="mailto:jorge.diazbenitosoriano@gmail.com">Jorge Antonio Díaz-Benito Soriano</a>:  (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/Mangarinos">http://www.facebook.com/Mangarinos</a>) As a software engineer, I am very concerned with software development processes and trends. I have a deep experience with RUP, which I think represents all the opposite to the Agile Manifesto, and I just can find advantages in the Manifesto.

So, I&#39;m signing the manifesto in order to manifest my support to its ideas.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ssb.indore@gmail.com">Santosh Singh</a>:  (Mechtronics Systems Pvt. Ltd.) Change management, time lines, client&#39;s involvement, continuous deliverable are the core issues for best performance of the team and Agile is the best and simplest to achieve all these.<hr>
<a href="mailto:martin.schulze@deutschebahn.com">Martin Schulze</a>:  (DB Systel) <hr>
<a href="mailto:smusa@myoci.ca">Salah Musa</a>:  (OCI Inc.) I have been practicing the principles of Agile methodology in Software development and project management for most of my career. Even before a name was put to the practice. I wholeheartedly endorse it. Having said that, it is often best to combine with the waterfall approach in very large projects. I have always done that with excellent results.<hr>

<b>John Stirton</b>:  (<a href="http://johnstirton.com/">John Stirton</a>) We have been using Agile-like policies to assist in the maintenance of various aspects of kitchen and office tasks. To say that they have been effective would be an understatement.<hr>
<a href="mailto:justintc@mac.com">Justin Chapman</a>:  (<a href="http://www.haigavenue.com">http://www.haigavenue.com</a>) I am an advocate of thinking that supports continuous self improvement. Scrum has enabled me to participate in large-scale projects that get demonstrable results with increased visibility and reduced team churn to produce quality work.</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000267.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

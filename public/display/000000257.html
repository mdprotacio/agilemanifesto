<b>Daniel Ketter</b>:  (<a href="http://www.thedkwt.com">EsE Design</a>) I have followed and endorsed Agile design principals since I began programming at age 9.
This ,for me, is more akin to common sense design with the human element protected.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wildshroom@me.com">Dave Collins</a>: I believe in Agile development. Having implemented the core concepts across many diverse teams. Agile provides context for tailoring software strategies to meet the unique needs of the situation that your team finds itself in. My primary aspect of adopting would be to mature your focus from just producing software, to providing a solution which meets the needs of its stakeholders, within the appropriate economic, cultural, and technical constraints. It simply works.<hr>
<a href="mailto:dp7264@earthlink.net">Donald L Palmer</a>: Fully supported<hr>
<b>Dave Thomson</b>:  (<a href="http://jazz.net">IBM Jazz Project</a>) The Agile Manifesto was a game changer, and the 12 principles are solid.  I often go back and re-read them to make sure I really believe we are following Agile practices at the IBM Jazz Project.  There is always the risk that some teams focus most on the practices that &quot;protect&quot; the development team or make the life of the developer easier, and gloss over the practices that are important for the stakeholders and essential to achieving the right outcome. I think one of the hardest for teams to really internalize is &quot;Welcome changing requirements, even late in development&quot;.<hr>

<b>Salahaldin Juba</b>: I have used both traditional software development and agile development methods, and I think waterfall model is a fictional model.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:tomasz@rozanscy.eu">Tomasz Różański</a>: Be Better, Be Efficient, Be Agile.<hr>

<a href="mailto:john_borys@comcast.net">John K. Borys Jr</a>: I have been using Agile development practices since 2005 and believe strongly in these principles. Not only because they work, but because they deliver a better product.  The emphasis on simplicity and daily communications with the business in a world of rapidly changing requirements ensures that the software delivered brings value the minute it&#39;s implemented. Using other methodologies often delivers software in immediate need of changes.  Unfortunately, Agile methodologies are often adopted piece meal by apprehensive leadership. When adopted in this fashion, Agile does not deliver success nearly as often.  Mixing waterfall and Agile processes can work, but I would rather have a root canal than participate in such a project.<hr>
<a href="mailto:smrolph@outlook.com">Simon Rolph</a>:  (Gentia Consulting) Having been involved in the Project Management business for  nearly 25 years in several different other industries the Agile approach to software development makes the most sense.  Others could learn from the Manifesto and the values it looks to support.<hr>

<b>Anssi Lehtelä</b>: As a tester and a pacifist, I do support the manifesto. <hr>
<b>Warren J Smyth</b>: A much more organic, and thus successful &amp; simplistic way of going about any kind of business. <hr>
<b>Jordi Torra Borras</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:mrsanjeevkumar@hotmail.com">Sanjeev</a>: I work as an Agile Coach and consultant. The future is Agile software development. In uncertain economic environment it is easy for a CIO to plan a software which gives returns on investment quickly. Gone are the days when CIO had luxory to plan for 2-3 years of investment and then get the software. To beat the increased competition and uncertain economic environment it is better to get the top priority product features faster. Agile is  here to help CIO and everybody involved in software development business. <hr>
<a href="mailto:giorgio.catucci@dhl.com">Giorgio Catucci</a>:  (DP DHL IT Services) I work in Process Improvements for an IT Group. Late 2011 I was tasked to document a process for software development following Agile/Scrum principles.

Over the last few months, I have applied the same principles to none software development related projects, and in particular to Process Improvement Initiatives following the DMAIC &amp; Lean Management framework, which are traditionally executed with a Waterfall Approach.

The results so far are great.

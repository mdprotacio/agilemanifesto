<b>Douglas Reynolds</b>:  (<a href="http://douglasreynoldsconsulting.com">Douglas Reynolds Consulting</a>) Agile practices, most importantly, provide us a better means of continued discovery throughout the project lifecycle.  We are better able to communicate and understand user requirements, break them down into logical chunks of functionality which defines our development of associated tests.  From test-driven-development, we are able to rapidly produce functional deliverables that meet the needs of our stakeholders and reduce the amount of un-needed code.  Developers, Project Managers, Sponsors, and users are all involved in the process, interacting and supporting the project.  Software is being developed that meets requirements, a collaborative environment exists, and we are able to respond to change requests in a dynamic manner which is supported in many ways, including Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development.<hr>

<a href="mailto:bond.chaturvedi@gmail.com">Somesh Chaturvedi</a>: I have been part of team struggling to understand the agile approach and is marred by the traditional thinking with aspiration to become agile development team.  However, it is understood that the 4 point manifesto does not only overs technical aspects instead it also shows considerations of real life challenges such as human interactions, adaptability , and agility to survive and deliver best softwares in world. <hr>

However, what i have observed during my experience is collection of large errors that have crept in the past and now we seem to be undoing what has been done so far. 
There has to be a lot more thrust to the agile methodology as a concept and i would welcome  organizations impose a penalty if not followed properly. If we think of the drain on the economy as a result of all these failures , i think we could have made Somalia as rich as USA. <hr>
<b>nick horne</b>:  (NHSBT) We have been exploring the benefits of adopting an Agile approach to developing systems having taken a largely waterfall approach to development which has not been largely unsuccessful. However as part of our drive to improve process efficiency we have adopted aspects of SCRUM and are exploring DSDM Atern, we have gained significant benefits from the adoption of some of the approaches and continue our journey to further adoption and improvement.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rcholsberry@innova-prime.com">Robert C Holsberry, PMP</a>:  (Innovative Primary Solutions, LLC) I was first introduced to the use of Agile concepts and methods in mid-2002; admittedly there was more than a little trepidation diving into it. Any concerns I had disappeared during the initial sprint and I haven&#39;t looked back. Agile has only continued to enhance the quality and success of the project management efforts I have overseen.   <hr>
<b>Ramakrishnan Srinivasan</b>: Agile is good. It is an attitude. It just makes horse sense. Think simply. Keep learning new things. Talk to the people around you. Run your thoughts and ideas by a few people. Build some good karma. Take your work seriously, but relax. Smile. :) Its ok. You will get it done. Be natural ... be agile ... be happy.<hr>
<b>Darko Kantic</b>:  (<a href="http://www.cyber-sundae.com">Cyber Sundae</a>) After 17 years in IT, I can only say, why wasn&#39;t this invented earlier! We were kind of using bits and pieces from a non-exsistant Agile on various projects, but it was considered  &quot;bad&quot; and had to be kept hidden from managers and customers. Now we can do it openly, great stuff!<hr>

<b>Dave McGowan</b>:  (Accenture) I support the agile manifesto.

I&#39;ve yet to see a &#39;true&#39; waterfall lifecycle implementation in any of the roles I&#39;ve been in. It has always ended up being some kind of ill defined ad-hoc hybrid  where lessons are never learned and the reams of documentation produced are uniformly never looked at again.

I support not wasting effort.<hr>
<a href="mailto:lmarkhigginspmp@aol.com">L Mark Higgins</a>: I&#39;ve believed in these principles for years. I have a memory of signing the manifesto years ago. But it must be an implanted one, because I couldn&#39;t find my name anywhere.<hr>
<a href="mailto:leonkehl@boxbrite.com">Leon Kehl</a>:  (<a href="http://www.boxbrite.com">BoxBrite Inc.</a>) I&#39;ve been developing software for many years and have pointed numerous people to the Manifesto.  Some truths are eternal and I think the Manifesto captures the essence of what leads to good software.  Only creative people can create good art.  People following a paint by numbers kit do not.  Software like art is a creative process and the same rules apply.<hr>
<b>Cahit Bağdelen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.eno.com.tr">ENO Information Technologies</a>) Promising principles, which may dramatically increase productivity and quality, provided that the individuals collaborate with a team sprit.<hr>
<b>Dontrell L. Banks</b>:  (NetServices, LLC) Who would&#39;ve thought that simple rules and guidelines could solve large and very complex problems?  I introduced Agile Software Development to a new team I had taken over to improve accuracy and reduce time to delivery for our software initiatives.  After only two release cycles, we have earned the praise of our customers and continue to grow as a software development and support group.<hr>
<a href="mailto:randyschmidt74@hotmail.com">Randy Schmidt</a>:  (<a href="http://atlantage.sharepoint.com">http://atlantage.sharepoint.com</a>) It just works...

As a warfighter with more than 23 years of living with what the &quot;engineers&quot; and their &quot;R&quot;equirements I have given up on that word and the old waterfall process it cannotes. Agile/Sprint/Scrum is the best method and pattern I have seen after more than 10 years of software development in the other practices. In it&#39;s purest form, there are no requirements, only desirements and realm of the possible.<hr>
<a href="mailto:daniel@bechtelus.net">Daniel Bechtel</a>: So much better in delivering usable results earlier than the &quot;usual&quot; approach.<hr>
<b>Colin Moore</b>:  (<a href="http://www.thoughtcorp.com">Thoughtcorp Systems Inc</a>) I&#39;ve worked in a waterfall environment most of my career.  I had the fortunate opportunity to learn and experience agile software development while on projects over the last 1-2years.  And what an eye opening experience it was!  We were able to successfully build a complicated portal on time and on budget...and most of all we were able to deliver value to our customer early and often.  In the end we not only delivered working software but working software that the customer wanted and valued!</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000223.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

<b>John R. Southern</b>:  (<a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/johnrsouthern">Softwerke</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:tc@tckon.eu">Tadeusz Cichocki</a>:  (<a href="http://tckon.eu">Dr Tadeusz Cichocki Konsulting</a>) First, try to understand what you have got really to achieve as a result of your activities, and be sure that your understanding and the actual progress are always valid. 
Second, put &quot;brain&quot; before any standard found in your organization or any method chosen; change or adapt them if needed.<hr>
<b>Silvia Boehm</b>: -- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
because the people make the software and they are going to use it.

-- Working software over comprehensive documentation, because you mostly do not need any doc, if the software is intuitive enough and works.

-- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, because contracts feed lawyers, collaboration feeds the product.

-- Responding to change over following a plan, because plans are only definitions of targets, and targets can always be adapted to real and actual needs.<hr>
<a href="mailto:marcos.brigante@gmail.com">Marcos Eduardo Soares Brigante</a>: Actually there&#39;s no other thoughts that can express better the way I wish to develop software than these value itens from the agile manifesto.
While each developer has endlessly points to evolve, with the manifesto we share the same starting point and the same compass which guide us along the evolving way. I truly believe in it, count with me.<hr>

<a href="mailto:hodit@pvppcoe.ac.in">Prof. P.S. Lokhande</a>:  (<a href="http://pslokhande.blogspot.com">PVPP College of Engineering</a>) It&#39;s an disciplined project management process which gives complete ownership of responsibility to each and every individual working in the project group. Here the need of customer is kept at the center point. <hr>

<a href="mailto:calledinspirit@yahoo.com">Ruben Cortes</a>: As a newbie to programming I must tell all that a simple and strong start to any task is paramount to success.  It is in this unity and harmony of matter in the subjective and objective worlds that we are flowing.  The flow is sweet and simple.  That is why I give you a KISS of joy and purpose.  The coming wind of knowledge is useless without a kite to fly and enjoy its power.  Thanks to all for your effort and love. <hr>

<b>Patrick Wilson-Welsh</b>: I have seen this work, and worked to make this work, for 9 years. My endorsement is a personal one. This is the way software wants to be built. <hr>

<b>Giuseppe Delledonne</b>:  (adfor) <hr>
<b>Amit Gupte</b>:  (<a href="http://acty-sys.co.in">Acty Systems India Pvt. Ltd</a>) We wish to benefit from using a more quantified approach across the entire implementation process. The main benefits of adopting such an approach include effective communication of the scope/requirements and better support for feedback and progress tracking. A great initiative here folks..<hr>

<b>Jorge Gamas</b>.<hr>
<b>JV MADHAVAN</b>:  (<a href="http://www.rockgmicrotech.com">ROCKG MICRO TECH</a>) Yes, in my, more than a decade, experience we always seen customers asking for changes in every part of the process. It would be good to have strong collaboration with customer to avoid last minute surprises. Agile (which embraces some level of documentation) could be a better alternative for current scenario.<hr>

<a href="mailto:relse@elseware.com">Robert Else</a>:  (<a href="http://www.elseware.com">ELSEWARE</a>) I believe software projects are primarily people projects. The technology is easy compared to the challenge of clear communication and productive interaction among the participants. If you get the people part right, the technology part usually turns out better than anyone expected. The Agile Manifesto supports this philosophy; I&#39;m all for it.<hr>
<b>Justin Rhinesmith</b>:  (<a href="http://www.justinrhinesmith.com">http://www.justinrhinesmith.com</a>) It has been my experience that these ideals, when followed, not only produce better software, but promote a more rewarding professional life as well.<hr>

<b>Gabriel Rinaldi</b>:  (<a href="http://www.gabrielrinaldi.me">Gabriel Rinaldi</a>) <hr>
<b>Kihara Absolomon</b>:  (<a href="http://www.movert.co.ke">Movert Technologies</a>) While its important to develop great applications, the process used should be simple enough to allow everyone on board to freely participate making everyone feel he/she is part of the team. The working environment should also be conducive enough for the developers and the clients to feel comfortable and confident that everyone is working together. These are the kind of principles being endorsed by agile that makes software development look more less than rocket science.<hr>
<b>Dieter Hönigmann</b>:  (<a href="http://www.n22.eu">n22 e.U.</a>) At the frontiers of truly innovative clinical applications, flexibility which comes along with agile software development is essential.<hr>

Zambrano</b>:  (<a href="http://www.origos.com">Origos</a>) The Agile Manifesto express perfectly the way I have been developing software successfully during the last 30 years.
The main Origos product has been getting bigger and bigger and more complex every day, forcing me to look for standards and models to maintain the control of the development. I couldn&#39;t find what I was looking for, until I found the Agile Manifesto.
Now I&#39;m fully aware that this is the only real way to go.<hr>
<a href="mailto:prashant.sharma@proteans.com">Prashant Sharma</a>:  (<a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/prashantsharepoint">Proteans Software Solutions</a>) Agile works for me and I think it can work for anyone. Like any new process give it the time, effort and focus it deserve and Agile will make things better you, even though if it doesn&#39;t do wonders right-away.

I would anyday recommend Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools  and a Working software over piles of Documents.<hr>
<b>Michael Furmaniuk</b>: Light-weight methods, open communication with a view of the historical are all aspects of a process I value and try to instill in the environments I am in.  I&#39;ve been using Agile in one form or another for years and it&#39;s never disappointed me.<hr>
<b>Mozart Brocchini</b>:  (<a href="http://www.bridge-way.com">Bridgeway Software</a>) Commitment to the manifesto makes us remember to always stick with what is important to deliver quality software on time. <hr>
<a href="mailto:bleiby@uncommonsolutions.com">Brad Leiby</a>:  (<a href="http://www.uncommonsolutions.com">Uncommon Solutions, Inc.</a>) We have found over the years, often in hindsight, that successful projects are determined less by the quality of the original plan than by whether a plan existed at all and whether stakeholders were aware of it.Further, the level of adherence to the plan is less predictive of success than the authenticity of the consideration given to the original plan as time passes, and the disciplined application of the learning that comes from this tension (resulting from the disparity between the original plan and reality) in repeatedly formulating and committing to a revised plan. In other words, we&#39;ve found through experience that the Agile Manifesto is &quot;spot on.&quot;<hr>
<b>Bruno Fontoura Costa</b>: I do endorse the agile methodoly<hr>

<b>Axelle Ziegler</b>:  (Ankama) <hr>
<a href="mailto:sazzadrafique@gmail.com">Sazzad Rafique</a>: From my experiences for last five years, this is the simple and obvious way software development should be practiced.<hr>
<a href="mailto:marcus.maute@accenture.com">Marcus Maute</a>: That&#39;s the way!<hr>
<a href="mailto:garyvecchio@hotmail.com">Gary Vecchio, PMP</a>: When your customer is faced with the challenges of an evolving threat and depends on mission-critical systems to neutralize those threats while minimizing casualties then you need a methodology that can meet those demands. <hr>

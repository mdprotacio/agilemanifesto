<a href="mailto:rob@skilstak.com">Rob Muhlestein</a>:  (<a href="http://skilstak.com">SkilStak, Inc.</a>) True Agile has functioned well for my peers and I over the years without even realizing it was Agile we were doing. Those projects were grassroots, organic, real, and they ended up being the most successful projects of my career. I continually see organizations struggle with this since they are inherently married to process of some kind--especially the bigger ones. Still, there is cause for hope as we, the peop--uh--programmers vow to follow Agile whenever possible despite the cruft of the aging, bureaucratic, organizations that--love &#39;em or hate &#39;em--will always be with us, paying our light bills, regulating our society, and keeping us safe. The Man might not be Agile, but we can be.<hr>
<b>Gene Kochanowsky</b>:  (Solution Sciences, Inc.) After several decades of experience, it has finally dawned on me that simple is better. And the Agile Manifesto certainly strives for that.<hr>
<a href="mailto:julius.depulla@gmail.com">JULIUS DEPULLA</a>: Software to the stakeholder is a means to an end, to the developer is an art. Business processes evolve rapidly, your ultimate goal as a developer is to code your customer&#39;s evolving business processes to satisfy their business needs. <hr>

<b>Rajesh Vijayakumar</b>:  (Analog Devices) The Agile manifesto takes a bold step towards delivering business value as a team rather than focusing on just individuals  <hr>
<a href="mailto:mrkbradley69@gmail.com">Mark Bradley</a>: Agile Methodologies represent a fundamentally better way to deliver valuable software to our customers. By signing the manifesto, I pledge to try to bring these principles to light for the unenlightened, and to continue to look for new ways to improve upon delivering value often to our organizations .<hr>

<b>Brett Martensen</b>: Too often those of us who develop software have followed practices that focus on things other than delivering value to our users.  After working on an agile team for several years, I support the Agile Manifesto, not as a new set of practices to replace the old, but as a means for us to stay focused on the things that are truly important.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:bkpandey.mca@gmail.com">Bhupendra Kumar Pandey</a>:  (Intellisoft Services) <hr>

<b>David W Ferguson</b>: This is how I have been working in software over the last 30 years anyway. I had not found such a straight forward way to express it before. I like the foundation that this short list of guiding principles can provide.<hr>
<b>Horacio Escalada</b>: I fully support the simple, inclusive and collaborative nature of the Agile Manifesto.<hr>

<a href="mailto:xrochard@gmail.com">Xavier Rochard</a>: Agile Manifesto doesn&#39;t need endorsement. Read it, understand it, apply it in your every day work. Its values will then show through what you deliver.<hr>
<a href="mailto:clucster@gmail.com">Celso Luiz Concheto</a>:  (IP@CCAM) I have worked hard on these principles, without even having knowledge of this manifesto, with which I fully agree and apply them in my day-to-day<hr>

<b>Frederico Augusto de Camargo</b>:  (<a href="http://about.me/fredericocamargo">http://about.me/fredericocamargo</a>) I really believe and practice the principles of the agile manifesto in my life, not only in software development. Discipline and collaboration are keys to a world in which the response to change and continuous feedback guide the direction of products and successful organizations.<hr>
<b>Simon Wilkinson</b>:  (<a href="http://www.practicalpmo.com">Practical PMO</a>) Since first using an agile approach in early 2001 I have been a big fan.  Getting business and developers to work together on a project does not only make for better results, it helps build teams.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rajesh.mahapatra@analog.com">Rajesh Mahapatra</a>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:jdeang@gmail.com">Joseph DeAngelis</a>: Agile is the quintessential development methodology of the new millennium, one that will teach development teams how to work together (self organize and manage, communicate and manage conflicts) and even more importantly grow together by creating instant engagement, self awareness and continuous improvement.<hr>
<a href="mailto:gstechsolutions@gmail.com">Gabriel Saldana</a>: I need to change the way I have been programming in the past 2 years.  Now that I have changed the design of my current project applying Agile methologies, now I feel more confident in making changes to existing code (new requirements) and it&#39;s easy for me to explain what I&#39;m working on through OOAD.<hr>

<a href="mailto:akmuhendislik@gmail.com">Turgut Saka</a>:  (AK consulting) First and last question is this : Is Agile software a reality? Many people as us is thinking yes some people find it funny dream but not a reality  However, as Kant puts it, things that are possible to our experience are supposed to have a cause and effect. However, this &quot;Agile&quot; if possible to our experience and causes thing to happen then what causes agile software?<hr>
<b>Ricardo Beltran</b>:  (<a href="http://www.indava.com">Indava</a>) I do believe that self organizing teams are possible, where each member could be trust and will take responsibility of their own work, for the sake and common goals of the team.

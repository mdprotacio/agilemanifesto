<a href="mailto:pradeepyamujala@hotmail.com">Pradeep Yamujala</a>: I worked with logistics domain and encountered many hurdles during development. These are mostly due to a gap while interpreting the customer stories by the developers. All of us heard customer voice at the beginning and at the ending. . Having big timescales will bring a gap with customer expectations and also having huge goals at shorter timescales will make software unproductive. Applying the Agile manifesto will definitely makes development is on track and at par with customer expectations.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dchanem@laposte.net">Doureradjou Chanemougame</a>: Hello,

I totally agree with the values you have highlighted, nowadays we have the tendency not to focus on essentials! These values are truly adequate to the current scenario where everything changes at a fast pace but strangely people stick to the values in the right side!

Warm regards,
Doureradjou Chanemougame <hr>

<a href="mailto:manoj.rai@mindteck.com">Manoj Kumar Rai</a>: The changes are inevitable part of the software development cycle. And a flexible plan that can incorporate changes at any stage of a project will certainly provide edge over competitors. “Responding to change” (without spending too much time on re-planning) is the basic idea for which I am a big supporter of this methodology. Concept of the frequent releases keep both parties *truly* at the same page during life cycle and that avoids unexpected changes at dying end of a project. I have noticed another wonderful benefit of the Agile methodology (frequent releases) that it keep the team members motivated as they quick feedback on their hard work.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sardina@list.ru">Polina Petrishcheva</a>.<td width="233"><b>Marco Cecconi</b>: As far as I know, there is no other feasible way of developing software. I&#39;ve tried a lot of different methodologies - no matter what your particular methodology is officially called, all good, meaningful and sensible practical implementations will necessarily fall towards agile, because that&#39;s how the world works.<hr>
<a href="mailto:samuelxuan@gmail.com">Gu Xuan</a>: I highly agree the Manifesto of Agile. The traditional software development methodology makes the commitment and planning so hard especially for the projects with a lot of variance. 

Looking forward to the progress of the Agile methodology...<hr>
<b>Valentin Malakhov</b>:  (hotelclub) I have always been a big supporter of Agile Approach since my first line of &quot;commercial&quot; code  back in the 90s. Back then I somehow felt that the distinction between the agile and waterfal was purely correlated with the size of the project, when the latter would be used for the projects with large budget. Also being a BI/DWH specialist, rather than web or .NET, makes it harder to apply agile methods, though the 12 principals can easily be applied.
We are currently working SCRUM and are very happy so far.

<b>Fred</b>:  (<a href="http://zh-ef.com/">Home Improvement</a>) I support the agial manifesto!<hr>
<b>Polo</b>:  (<a href="http://himprovement.net/">Home Ideas</a>) I believe Agile is the best way to go with software development and Agile Manifesto brings it forward to larger audience.<hr>
<b>David Sachdev</b>:  (<a href="http://www.innotac.com">Innotac, Inc.</a>) Agile Development is crucial in delivering to the customer the product that they want and need, rather then the product that they ask for.  We as technical leaders need to employ the tenets of the Agile Manifesto, and work hard to educate others on proper Agile Development.

<b>Otavio Ferreira</b>:  (<a href="http://mihswat.com/">MIH SWAT</a>) I&#39;ve been successfully applying the values and principles listed by this manifesto for three years. It is especially useful for environments in which requirements change quickly and often. As a clear context example, there is the development of Web applications and Web services.<hr>
<b>Calvin Madlock</b>:  (LACCD) Five years ago my past employer coined the phrase, “Changing the Game”, as an IT project theme.  I would like to coin a theme for my current employer: “The Game has Changed”.   The more I’ve researched facts regarding the Manifesto for Agile Software Development the more impressed I’ve become with the Agile process model in the evolution of software development.  I find that the Agile Manifesto model is appropriate for the today&#39;s software engineering efforts. <td width="233"><b>Libor Bus</b>:  (<a href="http://www.eccam.com">Eccam, Czech Republic</a>) Great ideas to follow!<hr>
<b>Tom</b>:  (<a href="http://doors-help.net/">Door reviews</a>) I totally agree on the principles behind the Manifesto. Only one doubt about documentation: also working software needs essential documentation.<hr>
<b>Ameet Shah</b>: Agile Methodologies should be the only way to build software<hr>
<a href="mailto:nedmaj@yahoo.com">Samuel Diniz Casimiro</a>:  (<a href="http://blogdosamueldiniz.blogspot.com/">http://blogdosamueldiniz.blogspot.com/</a>) Minha experiência me ensinou que bons desenvolvedores trabalhando em equipe, lado a lado, valorizando a livre comunicação sempre vão trabalhar melhor que qualquer equipe seja ela qual for, mas que estiver amarrada a processos muito formais produzindo documentação geralmente inútil. Backlog, diagrama de arquitetura e caso de uso: Precisa mais do que isso? O resto é boa comunicação e talento!<hr>

<b>Arjit Chatterjee</b>:  (RavenMyth Interactive Studios) Game Production is all about chasing uncertainty, knowing and believing in agile gives me the ability to foresee and react to changes comfortably. The more I understand agile the lighter, fun and more effective game production becomes for me. I hope to make this my second nature one day.<hr>

<b>David Weintraub</b>:  (<a href="http://www.FulcrumControls.com">Fulcrum Automation & Control Technologies</a>) Fulcrum Controls was started in 2001 by three people. We where fortunate in that we were motivated to make software, if for know other reason than to survive as a business. Over time we were lucky enough to find most of the Manifesto&#39;s principles by need. So supporting this manifesto, that helps make software better is as it should be &quot;a know brainer&quot;.<hr>

<a href="mailto:ericson18@gmail.com">Ericson Rafael</a>:  (Private) I really agree with all of the proposals presented here and I’d like to say that all of my students will be called to read and adopt this manifesto. Thank you all.<hr>
<b>Harpreet Sidhu</b>: Doing what&#39;s actually needed satisfies customers and developers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:emilio.gratton@tiscali.it">Emilio Gratton</a>: I fully support the Agile approach and its ability to help developers to work beyond single tasks.
My only doubt is about the word &quot;individuals&quot;. I&#39;d like to refer to the &quot;users&quot; instead. 
It&#39;s just because I&#39;d like to tailor a development for a position instead for a specific person that, sooner or later, might change. <hr>
<a href="mailto:gdavis@mcftech.com">Govind Davis</a>:  (<a href="http://www.mcftech.com">MCF Technology Solutions</a>) We were living Agile long before we even knew what it was .. . so exciting to find there are a world of others thinking about value over paperwork.<hr>

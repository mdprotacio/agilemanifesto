<a href="mailto:pkumar@k2tek.com">Prashant Kumar</a>: Had good taste of RUP, and feeling excited about using SCRUM/XP in my coming projects. Sometime back everybody was talking about PROCESSES and better PROCESSES(core aspect in CMM)..but Agile depends upon PEOPLE! May be after some time we move ahead to find another avenue for better PRODUCTIVITY!<hr>

I like the recognition of the importance of documentation and planning, while I appreciate the awareness of the limits of these concepts in and of themselves. This has been my trend and hope for years as a software development professional, and I am gratified to find it adopted and promoted at such high level, by a team of people whom I look up to. <hr>
<a href="mailto:eduardo@mg5.us">Eduardo Marquez</a>: I have been delivering solutions for over 25 years in different capacities--developer, analyst, SQA Manager, Project Manager, Software Development Manager and user--while trying different methodologies and with different rigor in project management.  With all this experience I can say that Agile Software Development summarizes what the majority of us in the software industry knows and wish to do.

It is all about delivering working useful solutions to our clients, what a concept!

I gladly sign the Agile Manifest.<hr>
<b>Paul Sinnema</b>:  (<a href="http://www.paulsinnema.com">http://www.paulsinnema.com</a>) I&#39;ve been an IT Person since 1970 and still am. Only 2 years ago got into Agile. Haven&#39;t been able to do a lot in current projects but still believe Agile to be much better then the way I&#39;ve been doing things. Trying to convince people has become one of my prime goals but it&#39;s not easy, especially in those environments where there&#39;s a lot of management relying on old phylosophies and a lot of money is involved!<hr>
<a href="mailto:dexgus@gmail.com">Andre Gusmao</a>:  (<a href="http://www.castmeta.com.br">CASTMETA  Informatica</a>) My company in Brazil deals with teh same problems on a daily basis: changing requirements, non-working software, unsatisfied customers, unprofitable projects and so on. To only way to we have found to resolve this issues is exctaly the principles of the Agile Manifesto. Count me in to spread the word in Brazil.<hr>
<a href="mailto:smishra@thoughtworks.com">Satyadarshi Mishra</a>:  (<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>) Agile techniques are specific to Software development and that&#39;s why they make more sense. 

These practices are not are adopted from other industries like construction and therefore are more effective.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tglimwin2000@yahoo.com">Ghent Lim</a>:  (University of Windsor) Go Agilefactor!<hr>
<a href="mailto:teoman@email.co.yu">Teoman Delov</a>:  (<a href="http://www.teoz.tk">D.E.Ü.</a>) I absolutely agree to this manefesto!<hr>
<b>Vladimir Levin</b>:  (Wireless Matrix) Agile development is not about cobbling software together willy nilly. On the contrary, agile development is about professionalism and discipline. But it is also about being practical, common sense, and getting real results. <hr>
<a href="mailto:jeb.himsl@rxamerica.com">Jeb Himsl</a>:  (RxAmerica) <td width="233"><b>Claudia Pozo</b>:  (Burger King Corporation) everything this manifesto stands for helps your IT team build better working relationships with the business creating a flexible environment for the users where they feel like they are getting what they need!!!!

Working as a team and doing away with many of the processes, tools, and documentation required today to develop applications makes your IT Team more productive and creates a better environment to work in.

<a href="mailto:gw2ksoft@hotmail.com">G. Ashok Kumar</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:Riks2@smoo.com">Rik Fischer Smoody</a>:  (<a href="http://www.smOO.com">smOOdynamics</a>) Choir practice is fun, but there&#39;s still a huge amount of converting to do.  I suspect that the revolution will happen by evolutionary processes: as individuals leave and are replaced by more enlightended young&#39;uns.  Would that we could speed it up, but too many people won&#39;t learn new tricks nor adopt new philosophies.<hr>
<b>Mark Carter</b>:  (Dow Chemical) I find it amazing how IT keeps searching for &quot;the answer.&quot;  
The Agile Manifesto simply makes it clear:   listening, managing change, managing action, and managing feedback are central to being responsive(or agile if you prefer).

Well done. <hr>
<b>Erik Ableson</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jai.jayaraman@patni.com">jai pradeep</a>:  (<a href="http://www.patni.com">Patni</a>) I am supporting AGILE because i feel that a lot of time is wasted in the so called Six Sigma processes and if we could save our time and use it for adding value to the product. I feel that approximately, 20 percent of the time is wasted in documentation and another 20 percent wasted in reading documents. It would be better if someone could just show for 5 mins that this is what to be done instead of reading the document for some 8 hrs and yet not understanding it. The worst thing is trying to read the whole functionality before doing anything. Its hard for a person to understand the full functionality and from my experience, i found that its a waste of time to read the docs and all i learn is by doing it, right or wrong. when there are too many documents and too many places where they are found, its very easy for anyone to get lost in the maze of the knowledge documents just as anyone trying to search a topic on the web would get lost.<hr>

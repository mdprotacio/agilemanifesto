<a href="mailto:babakehakimi@gmail.com">Babak Esmailzadeh Hakimi</a>:  (Sinam Co.) I think and feel this as a humanistic approach, philosophically. Softwares are the cultural clothes we wear on our nature to make our nature more humanistic. This way, we are getting more complicated with spirits moving away from our simple nature and  being close to our  deepest dreams ever : Being Human! just human, not more!<hr>
<b>Martyn</b>: I support it!<hr>
<a href="mailto:weekes62@yahoo.com">Mark S. Weekes</a>:  (Woodhull Medical Center) Having convinced my usually cautious manager to try this methodology on a semi critical project. He was most surprised at the level of control and accountability in the process even without a big requirement document created pre-development.
The customer was happy to be engaged and get quick tangible feedback from our meetings. She felt the process was very user friendly and responsive to her needs. I look forward to learning more and using it. <hr>
<b>Ranga Ramasastry</b>:  (<a href="http://www.netapp.com">NetApp</a>) I have found adoption of agile development methodlogies has resulted in beeter predictiablity, higher quality and higher level of satisfaction among software engineers<hr>

<a href="mailto:carlojm@intelligenttechservices.com">Carlo J. Mercieri</a>:  (<a href="http://intelligenttechservices.com/">Intelligent Technology Services Incorporated</a>) Over years interacting with clients we have come to realize and experience the interrelationships we have getting needs, challenges done through these very principles. 

Issues tend to only arise on the fray where communication and dynamic flexibilty are not part of the process.

In this sense the manifesto is a working framework for not only software development but how the various models of the technological environment relate.

From the individual developer to the managed service povider, a true system of dynamic processes and methods make the end result a positive experience and a working end result for the client.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Jonathan.Jenkins@ClearlyAgile.com">Jonathan Jenkins</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ClearlyAgile.com">Clearly Agile, LLC</a>) It all started with Kent Becks book.  I am such an advocate yet working in federal workspaces can be challanging since they still do not &quot;get it&quot;.

Hence why I am starting a company that focuses on a community within the fed.  While a paper in 2010 from the federal CIO said we should impliment Agile it has yet to be championed.   Grrrrr

Anyway....Agile baby!

<b>Dang En Ren</b>:  (<a href="http://https://jazz.net/">IBM</a>) Agile reiterates interactions among individuals, especially with customers. Tools and processes are just there to assist the collaboration. In IBM China system test team, the core objective is to simulate customer scenarios. Through in-house deployment and upgrade in every milestone, we adopt our own products and evaluate quality early in the game, together with end users from other departments and external Beta customers. This offers us a great chance to collect customer feedback promptly and &quot;embrace changes&quot; easier throughout the development life-cycle.<hr>

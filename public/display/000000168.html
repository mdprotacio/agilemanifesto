It is there that we are reminded of the ultimate goal of writing software, which is to help people.<hr>

Be it in terms of objective to lead, participate, trust, focus, speed and delivery. Sometimes thinking out of the problem helps a lot more and so is agile.<hr>

<b>Jaggi Ayyangar</b>:  (<a href="http://www.volti.com">Volti, Inc.</a>) We do a lot of offshore development work and IMO Agile is the only methodology that works.

As a consumer of development, I dont want to see internal processes from the organizations.  I would rather base my assessment of the progress on the deliverables (Sprints) and very key interface specs.

From a program management standpoint, I can show the sprints to my end-customers, and get their feedback every 2-4 wks. This way we can take corrective action (spec change, design change, add more coders, strengthen test cases, etc.) at each sprint and thereby ensure a more predicatable result. 

I dont know of a more rational (no pun) way to ensure software project success.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jim.clark@atcoitek.com">James Clark</a>: I have been using Agile methods for the last 10 years on projects ranging in size from under $500K to $9 million. In every case, applying the agile principles and spirit of the agile manifesto has produced superior results and extremely satisfied clients.<hr>

<b>David Bowen</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:thasabara@gmail.com">Thais Sabará</a>: The agile manifesto came to open up the minds of those ones that does not believe that software can be built without the overhead of generating documentations that won&#39;t be read or updated or those people that believes that a software development must follow a strict plan, with no way of changing the official script, as a waterfall mind. The success of a project is related to the good understanding of requirements and flexibility to chage it, if necessary.Also, the involvement of the team of the project is directly proportional to the quality that this software will have when it&#39;s done.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wdsanders@comcast.net">William B. Sanders, Ph.D.</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sandlight.com">Sandlight Productions</a>) Agile development is important for practical results; not ideological beliefs. Of all of the values for survival Responding to Change is the most important. Any software development that does not have an eye to change will ultimately fail because change is not a variable; it is a constant.<hr>
<a href="mailto:perera_heshan@yahoo.com">Anthony Heshan Perera</a>: I&#39;m new to this field, in fact I&#39;m still a student studying software engineering. I&#39;ve been reading up on several software development methodologies such as the traditional waterfall model, prototyping, rapid application development etcetera. Though my opinion probably wouldn&#39;t count much due to my immaturity in the field, i would like to post my thoughts on the Agile development philosophy.

1.)

I really like the JIT approach being employed in most of its planning, designing and funding aspects. This is because I feel that it provides for a very cautious way of getting about managing. Apart from this, it shows tangible results way faster vis-a-vis other methodologies which would reduce the chances of frustration building up within developers and stakeholders as well.
   
2.)

From the way i see it, each &quot;Sprint&quot; period focuses on completing baby steps, requiring minimal funding on the way. The customer seemingly pays for the effort / amount of work done (each baby step that is taken). This way, the customer can see how the project is turning out with each an every minute development, hence could decide to abort further development, saving time and money.

3.) 

The Agile philosophy provides for other quite obvious advantages such as high level of stakeholder involvement and transparency while ensuring that any advancements can be made to the system at any time, provided that they&#39;re willing to invest the extra time and money.

Hope I&#39;ve SOME kind of value-add.

<b>Nathan Lane</b>:  (Ultradent Products Inc.) Software needs change too rapidly, requirements for better more stable software are of higher importance, and people are more important than processes. I endorse fully the Agile Manifesto, and develop by it.<td width="233"><b>Michael DePaoli</b>: After 22 years in the software development industry I can state, without reservation, that values and principals listed in the Agile Manifesto, appropriately applied to an organizational and problem domain context, provide the best opportunity to extract maximum value from software development endeavors.<hr>

<b>Rafeeq Badiger</b>: Agile Manifesto addresses the gap between the stakeholder, Business and the Software
development team. Since getting together face-to-face frequently helps in discussions
between the software development team and the business people, it
helps the development team to understand the business requirements 
by putting more questions to the business and getting answers from the business
which would help the development team to better understand the
requirements and build the software bug-free satisfying the business.

Agile methodology breaks the work into smaller iterative tasks and hence helps
avoid major corrections at the end of product delivery, at each task the business
knows what their expectations were and what they got as the end result and if any 
changes are needed things can be corrected in that task before proceeding to the next
task. It helps in effective team building and helps the team to become more effective
at regular intervals and have technical excellence. 

Thanks for the value added Agile Manifesto and this will take to the new heights 
and a better approach to project management.<hr>

<a href="mailto:yawarbaig@gmail.com">Mirza Yawar Baig</a>:  (<a href="http://www.yawarbaig.com">Yawar Baig & Associates</a>) Absolutely brilliant. I am so happy to see this actually written down and lived by. I think that more and more we are living in a world where we know a great deal but we practice little. That is why we are in danger of becoming extinct even though it will be written that we knew all the reasons why we became extinct. I think this manifesto states upfront the importance of living by our values, of communicating with each other and of standing up for what it right. I endorse this fully.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sal@saldistefano.com">Sal DiStefano</a>: To me Agile is about balance and keeping your eye on the prize. My interests are in how Agile practices can be used in large software projects where the value of Plans, Processes and Contract tend to have the highest value. I believe without Agile balance large projects tend to fail.<hr>

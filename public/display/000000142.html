<a href="mailto:julien.mazloum@outsofting.com">Julien Mazloum</a>:  (<a href="http://www.outsofting.com">OutSofting</a>) I am proudly signing this Agile Manifesto. I agree this is the way software should be developed. The path is still long until we finally create a real profession for software developers but this was an important milestone on the way forward.<hr>
<b>Lorenzo Bortolotto</b>:  (<a href="http://www.norissoftware.it">Noris Software</a>) this is the right way to develop and improve our software!<hr>
<b>Greg Chatham</b>: It&#39;s made sense in three organizations where I&#39;ve helped roll it out.  I like making my Customers happy and I&#39;ve been able to do that much more often since I started down this path 9 years ago.<hr>
<b>jeroen crabbe</b>:  (EDS/HP ) great <hr>
<a href="mailto:mmittal2000@gmail.com">Manish Mittal</a>:  (<a href="http://www.avaya.com">Avaya Inc</a>) I totally agree because this is totally meant for the benefit of customer, who finally needs the product.

The Change is requirement is easy to handle.

Also, Only motivated and responsible people can be accountable and make it work , so thats very important but as well make everybody understand that it may / may not always be the case :(<hr>
<a href="mailto:oopazob@saire.cl">Osvaldo Opazo Berrios</a>:  (<a href="http://www.infocomin.cl">Infocomin</a>) Our small company is located in Chile and we recently launched in the agile development process,

Thanks<hr>

<b>Jeffrey Ridout</b>:  (<a href="http://blog.itwarlocks.com">http://blog.itwarlocks.com</a>) Software and (web)applications are becoming more and more intuitive, they feel more natural. Why not make the engineering process them the same way, agile?<hr>

<a href="mailto:jerryrajamoney@yahoo.com">Jerry Rajamoney</a>: I am using the Agile Scrum framework for my projects for the past 4+ years. I have gained many advantages by using the Agile Scrum. The satisfaction level of my clients have gone high after my team stated using Agile Scrum.

I am a big fan of Agile and I am proud to be part of this.

<b>Jayanthi CV</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:gtadao@gmail.com">Gustavo Tadao Okida</a>: It is really amazing how this method works well when we have business and IT together. It not only a model of work but style of work and, although it is not ever appliable, it should be considered independent of company IT methodology.<hr>
<a href="mailto:seewood@gmail.com">Daniel Shi</a>:  (<a href="http://seewood.blogspot.com">http://seewood.blogspot.com</a>) Management is about both science and art. And it&#39; not only about methodology but also about attitude. I hope my team and me would be more agile!<hr>

<b>Ilker Cetinkaya</b>:  (<a href="http://www.gmbsg.com">www.gmbsg.com</a>) It took me years to truly adapt agile principles. I&#39;ve been following the agile movement since 3 years now and hereby state, that being agile is one of the key factors to software engineering success. Whilst agile thinking and doing is obligatory, it only is a fraction of the whole to professional software engineering.<hr>

<b>Eriksen Costa Paixão</b>:  (<a href="http://eriksencosta.wordpress.com">http://eriksencosta.wordpress.com</a>) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:miguel.rosario@gmail.com">Miguel Rosario</a>: Delivery of good, clean, and well designed software is the key to providing the competitive edge. Over-designed apps usually die in the face of rapidly deployed agile apps. Under-designed apps are the bane of software maintenance and are spared death at times dependant on how well their ally Mr. Refactoring can assist; usually though, he is the one ordering the execution of the same. Middle ground must be sought.<hr>
<b>Guenter Zachmann</b>: After more than 30 years experience in software development I recognize the principles behind Lean, Agile and Scrum as the methods that ever have been used intuitively in development of successful software products. 
Success usually leads to career opportunities, growth of organization and divergence of expertise and decision-making authority, and then processes are required to close the gap between hierarchies, collaborating sub-orgs, authority and expertise. There is a high seduction to implement an increasing number of processes to satisfy the demands of hierarchies, individuals in leading positions end even processes previously existing. In the progressed state misrouted processes cause a kind of self-strangulation, which leads to loss of motivation on the expert levels, loss of creativity and innovation, failure of competitive products and finally loss of success.
I&#39;m full of hope that the spirit of Lean and Agile will be able to crack the vicious circle of self-strangulation by misrouted processes and to bring back sanity and reason to development of software products in bigger organizations.<hr>

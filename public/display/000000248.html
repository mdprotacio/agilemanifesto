This Manifesto reflects and supports this idea.<hr>
<b>Valculescu Claudiu</b>: Because of its modern principles, Agile approach will probably have, in the years to come, a strong impact over the next generation of software developers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:glen.wang@ericsson.com">Glen Wang</a>:  (<a href="http://ericsson.com">Ericsson</a>) I believe Agile is more close to the nature of human being and can greatly utilize individual&#39;s potential.<hr>
<a href="mailto:santhaoliver@yahoo.com">Santha Oliver</a>.<hr>
<b>Andrada Demian</b>.<hr>
<b>Murzea Radu</b>: In today&#39;s extremely dynamic IT and business world, we just can&#39;t live without Agile.<hr>

<b>Oana BELEI</b>.<hr>
<b>Rob Finean</b>:  (<a href="http://rfinean.tripod.com/">Finean</a>) I&#39;ve been a fan of these refreshing principles ever since 2003 when I first set about weaning an established organisation off the waterfall. I&#39;ve found young developers get it instantly but their senior managers need lots of convincing that it&#39;s worth constantly improving their comfortably familiar business process. Bringing the benefits of keeping control and minimising work-in-progress back to these 4 principles helps enormously. <hr>
<a href="mailto:margineanmadalina@gmail.com">Madalina Marginean</a>.<hr>
<b>Raymonde Guindon</b>: I am Raymonde Guindon, the researcher that showed that software design does not follow a waterfall model, but rather an opportunistic (agile) model
**Designing the design process: Exploiting opportunistic thoughts - Human-Computer Interaction, 1990 
** Knowledge exploited by experts during software system design - International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 1990 
** Breakdowns and processes during the early activities of software design by professionals - Empirical Studies of Programmers, 1987
These very early studies clearly showed that the waterfall model is too rigid for modern software development practices<hr>
<b>Eduardo José de Oliveira</b>: I agree and sign. The Agile Software Development is an excellent approach.<hr>
<b>Dragos Dreptate</b>.<hr>
<b>Evgeniy</b>:  (<a href="http://cheloveche.ru">Snegoffon</a>) This is really good practices.<hr>
<a href="mailto:gibbont2@nationwide.com">Tim Gibbons</a>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:cpatterer@gmail.com">Christian Patterer</a>: I strongly support the values and principles of the agile manifesto as it&#39;s - in my  opinion - a very efficient way of developing software and satisfying the customer. Applying the values and principles, it builds a strong team, delivering better solutions in a shorter time with more fun.
In addition, I think that the values and principles can also be applied to other projects and situations - not even necessarily software development.<hr>
<b>Chris Wright</b>: I absolutely believe in the agile method of developing software.  It does take commitment and understanding from all areas within the business to make it work effectively.  If you get it right, you will always follow the agile way.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sbuljat@gmail.com">Stjepan Buljat</a>:  (Etna) Finally a set of universal principles that make sense!
This is not a methodology so don&#39;t try to find step-by-step guide how to implement it, it&#39;s a way of thinking and doing.
Agile is my way.<hr>
<b>Renato Brazioli</b>: Agile is about appropriateness and balance.

Appropriateness, by using the proper mean to pursue the desired result and by leveraging on available resources (people, skills, tools), thus achieving balance of costs incurred and results achieved.<hr>
<b>Jacob George</b>: We have used the manifesto as base framework to adapt our software development methedology on the course of a project.<hr>

<a href="mailto:tonikhil@ymail.com">Nikhil</a>:  (<a href="http://www.intergraph.com">Intergraph India</a>) I here by support the implementation of Agile Manifesto not just in software industry but also where ever we interact with customers.
As it gives value to customer bonding than profits.<hr>
<b>Pep Jurjo</b>:  (<a href="http://www.abbeyweb.com">AbbeyWeb.com</a>) I support this principes. As a Free-Lancer and small company runner it&#39;s maybe the unique way to go.

You can always find a faster way to do things, yo caun always adapt to customer needs. To do so this principes help a lot.

<b>Shawn Cicoria</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:mikebergafu@yahoo.com">Afu Mike-berg Sitsofe</a>:  (AmskRya Group Ghana) No machine is as intelligent as human. Dynamism is the Human strength, we can adapt creative ways to new situations therefore our interaction in every situation solves the problem but not the machine. And also the basis of any machine is man. 

Based on the above submissions I duly endorse the Agile approach and become a signatory<hr>
<a href="mailto:ildatanoglu@hotmail.com">Ilda Tanoglu. MA. PMP</a>:  (Software Consultant & Project Manager) As Confucius states it, “Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.”. So let us place our feet back to the ground, be realistic, and re-simplify whatever we have previously complicated!...<hr>
<b>Wikus Verreynne</b>:  (<a href="http://www.8to5.co.za">8to5</a>) The agile manifesto has helped us improve our development life cycle, shorten go to market times and in general helped us build better software.

We are now able to respond to market requirements much quicker and as a result our user are happier.<hr>
<b>Fernando Blanco</b>:  (<a href="http://www.compumatic.net/">Compumatic Netsearch</a>) Agile Manifesto stresses which are the important values in the process of software creation and which ones are not so important.<hr>

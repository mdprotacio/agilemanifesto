The work is based on my experience in participating and managing IT projects during the last 7 years. In my opinion the Manifesto describes the best, what software development is all about. Being flexible is one of the most important attributes of either an individual or a whole project.<hr>

<a href="mailto:jsnauwaert@lycos.com">Jan Snauwaert</a>:  (Information Quality Consulting) The quality of the (software) development - in ALL its aspects - seems a bit lacking to me in the Agile Manifesto, that, otherwise, I find very meaningful and intelligent.<hr>

I really appreciate the activities of Agile software developments,and i&#39;m supporting its manifesto . i also want to develop new and useful software which are more powerful and userfriendly than ever. As i&#39;m doing my Master of science in Advanced software engineering from University of Leicester in United Kingdom.The teachings of this university is excellent than any of the university in the world.
                      thanks.<hr>
<a href="mailto:villatore@yahoo.com.mx">Lisandro</a>: I&#39;m interesting about taking more knowledge in this king of work.
I&#39;m administering some projects, but I want to know another methodology.

Thanks a lot.<hr>
<a href="mailto:SEGH@OPTONLINE.Net">James Bergman</a>:  (SEGH Corporation) I have been a software developer for and now architect for over 25 years. I started on PDP-11&#39;s writing assembly code, moved up through Fortran and C then C++.

Most if not all of my past projects have been at banks. The applications were developed using a form of Agile development methodology where we communicate face-to-face on aspects of design and development. 

Documentation was always produced, in parallel, using technical writers. First and foremost was always the delivery of a high-quality product (mostly for selfish reasons since none of us like production support roles).

Recently the edict is documentation before development. The reason this has become some important is that since many of the development tasks are performed overseas with low priced labor. You always get what you pay for. In my experience, if its not spelled out on paper for these overseas developers, it will not be done. A recent experience proved this point. Error checking was not performed because it wasn&#39;t spelled out in the documents.

Agile is awesome!<hr>
<b>Alex Black</b>:  (<a href="http://www.turingstudio.com">the turing studio, inc.</a>) We adhere to the sense of these documents for all of our client and internal projects. We&#39;ve naturally found through experience that most if not all of these concepts are correct.<hr>

Uribe</a>:  (<a href="http://www.bahiasoftware.com">bahiasoftware.com</a>) I couldn&#39;t agree more with the manifesto.  Cut the red tape.  It is really an acceptance that the usefulness of documentation has a limit and it always misses a large number of items that are only discovered during the development process.  Agility and interaction with the user is what is needed, not increased processes, pre-development documentation and contract negotiation.<hr>
<a href="mailto:shamri@bcs.org">Mohamed Shamri Ahafurdeen</a>:  (Informatics Group) With the rapid changing of Softwrae and Technology i assume that the Agile methodology would work. This method more focus on Customrs needs in a little time scale(Time boxing).So i personnaly prefer AGILE.....<hr>

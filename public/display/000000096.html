<a href="mailto:GhimanshuG@gmail.com">Himanshu Gupta</a>: I like Agile approach because it is closer to the way a human would behave normally and hence this makes it more intuitive.<hr>
<b>Vidhya</b>: Though we have been following many of the principals of Agile in the name of XP, I understand XP is just one of the Agile methodologies in existence. Agile is thus more adaptive and flexible to make it suitable to our individual environments.<hr>
<b>Mike Robinson</b>: Over 40 years experience as a developer has taught me that delivering working software is more important than rigorous planning, inflexible methodologies and all the fads we&#39;ve seen come and go in the last few decades.

Software development is an art, not a science. This is easily demonstrated by the number of programming languages that are available, and the number that are no longer used. <hr>

However am using my version of the method which will be published in 2008. The version have been widely advertised and is presently examined and accepted as my research desertation at the University of Port Harcourt. It is very consistent with the Agile Manifesto. <td width="233"><b>zhixuan zhu</b>:  (bowling green university) <hr>

Need you say more.<hr>
<a href="mailto:elavarasu.thankappan@gmail.com">T.C.P.Elavarasu</a>: I support the Agile manifesto. Certainly, the Agile Manifesto should not be mis-understood as an &#39;undisciplined way&#39; of doing things.Systems are not &quot;engineered&quot;, they &quot;evolve&quot;. Programming is the dialog between engineer and the software.An excellent software emerges by a process of continious refinement. Attention on Communication is obviously a good idea. Communication between a developer and an end user is very much crucial. I certainly agree that it is a good thing to build projects with the help of motivated individuals,give them the environment,the support they need, and trust them to get the job done. <hr>

<a href="mailto:shane.currier@verizon.net">Shane Currier</a>:  (<a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com">Atlas, a division of AQuantive, a subsidiary of Microsoft</a>) I don&#39;t know what took me so long to submit this.  I&#39;ve been an agile fan, specifically xp, since 2000. 

I&#39;m currently a development manager at Atlas, and previously at AttachmateWRQ, coaching the agile transition of teams working on legacy c++ codebases.<hr>
<a href="mailto:drjojic@gmail.com">Dragan Jojic</a>:  (<a href="http://www.conchango.com">Conchango PLC</a>) It has been three years since I &#39;discovered&#39; and started practicing and coaching Agile and Scrum in particular.  In that time, I have consistently seen and been involved in successful projects delivered around Agile values.  Likewise, I have experienced less successful ones where the &#39;trust&#39; was built on elaborate contracts, the delivery  based on processes and tools, and the progress directed and measured through rigid plans.  It is my firm belief that Agile Manifesto articulates a better way to deliver projects.</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000095.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

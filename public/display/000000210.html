<b>Franco Ordoñez L</b>: I used for my engineer project, makes good work<hr>
<b>Gian Mahil</b>:  (<a href="http://www.applied-agile.com">Applied-Agile</a>) We have found that the Agile approach can be applied to most business procedures and skills.   

Applying a Agile approach will lead to better results , more quickly with fewer resources AND heppier clients.

Respecting human creativity &amp; individuality vs. treating people like lifeless code-churning machines. Everything else follows this principle. [there&#39;s a reason this is the first point in the manifesto]
*Documentation - 
The speed of trust / honesty system vs. nitty-gritty documentation that nobody reads when all we want to know is Does it work?
*Is this what you want?
Customers getting their hands on the product as quickly as possible. Think back to waterfall, the most exciting time is right before delivering the product for user acceptance testing.
*Changes -
Plans are not set in stone! There needs to be a culture shift here.<hr>
<b>Jignesh Jani</b>:  (Zensar Technologies Ltd.) Agile Software Development for me is like a breeze of fresh air in to a close room. I have been enjoying my work more ever since i started using Agile Software Development. It is more fun, higher quality and a good human touch to everything you do. Top of it, every month i deliver something that really works for my clients who are in a business that is every changing.<hr>
<b>Prakash Bettadapur</b>: Agile is the common sense approach. Even before the formalized approach, we followed Agile under different names. The manifesto and the principles can be applied to create a set of commandments to follow in an organization. Go Agile!!!<hr>
<b>Evandro Sviercowski</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ashishsingh.fzd@gmail.com">Ashish Singh Chauhan</a>:  (Dell Services) I agree with the AGILE MANIFESTO. Agile methods have lead the traditional way of software development to a refined approach incorporating all the best practices of existing development models.

Agile methodology is the best and really impressed me with the scrum call and customer collaboration. More communication has proven extremely valuable in the development process allowing everyone to give their best for the benefit of the software being developed.

<a href="mailto:rbonora@gmail.com">Renata</a>:  (<a href="http://www.oglobo.com.br">Infoglobo</a>) Started workting with Agile on 2010 and already applied it on 3 projects.
The last one was improved by the use of Kanban. First project in the company and now we have at least 3 with Kanban and around 5 using framework Scrum.<hr>
<a href="mailto:melo.projetos@gmail.com">Maury Melo</a>:  (Consultant) As a consultant I consider the agile methodology a smart way to manage projects.<hr>

<a href="mailto:parikh_rajesh@yahoo.com">Rajesh</a>:  (Accenture) <td width="233"><b>Stefan Papp</b>:  (<a href="http://remix.codeplex.com">Rubicon</a>) All our products that are hosted on http://www.re-motion.org, http://remix.codeplex.com or http://relinq.codeplex.com had been created with Agile Software Development.

It would not have been possible to create these fine products in a non agile way.<hr>

<b>Jonathan Keam</b>: My personal (and somewhat corny) motto has always been: &quot;Teamwork makes the dream work&quot; and nothing I&#39;ve seen has come to encapsulate that more than going Agile.<hr>

<a href="mailto:saminathan.r@gmail.com">Saminathan Raju</a>:  (CIBER Inc) I strongly believe in agile for a rapidly changing and competitive environment.  It helped us a lot in getting the up-to-date deliverable at all times.  Its a win-win situation as in the end result would be of up-to-date, and due to change in requirements, there are chances for the code, design betterments thus makes a developer more valuable.<hr>

<a href="mailto:jchalkley@att.net">Joan Chalkley</a>: WOW!!!  I have been doing Waterfall development for over 25 years.  It seemed like such a struggle getting things done.  I just had a two day Scrum Master class, so I haven&#39;t applied the concepts in &quot;real life&quot;.  Still AMAZING - work would be FUN and STIMULATING with this approach!<hr>

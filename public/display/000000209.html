<b>Matthew Jackson</b>:  (iKepler, Inc.) The Agile Manifesto has helped us focus on people and change rather than busy work.  This makes keeping our customer&#39;s needs at the forefront of everything we do.<hr>
<b>Hanolex Huang</b>:  (<a href="http://hanolex.org">hanolex.org</a>) It&#39;s amazing.<hr>
<a href="mailto:alberto.deangeli@gmail.com">Alberto De Angeli</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:romain@vignes.me">Romain Vignes</a>: Values and principles from the Manifesto are the foundations of all effective agile teams.
Practices and methodologies are only implementation details.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sudhir.sriramoju@gmail.com">Sudhir Kumar Sriramoju</a>: I am a great believer of Agile!<hr>

<b>Tomasz de Jastrzebiec Wykowski</b>:  (<a href="http://procognita.com">ProCognita</a>) I&#39;m glad to see, that after 10 years Agile Manifesto is still accurate and valid. Now change &quot;software&quot; into &quot;product &amp; services&quot; and you get manifesto that goes far beyond software development.<hr>
<b>Anu Magal-Smalley</b>.<hr>
<b>David McGuinness</b>: Scrum and agile practices have completely reformed how we work (in a good way) and we now have happier customers too. So, thanks!<hr>

<a href="mailto:harri.lampela@aina.fi">Harri Lampela</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ainacom.fi">AinaCom Oy, Finland</a>) Agile seems to have many brilliant points to follow. I have worked over 10 years in different kind of projects as a project manager and only one large project in my project history has realized from start to finish as planned in the beginning. Customer value have always been my leading value in my project-work and Agile brings several good methods to apply that value in real (project) life. Keep on going with those values!<hr>

<a href="mailto:glenn.villadsen@comcast.net">Glenn Villadsen</a>: Somebody should make a movie: &quot;Forward to the Past&quot;. Up until the mid-90&#39;s (at least in my experience) agile programming was the norm, management trusted software, and the system mostly worked. Then three things happened:

1. Management decided that software engineeering is a process, and that anyone can be trained to follow the process. In truth, software engineering is a craft, and some people simply do not possess the abstract reasoning skills required to make good software. We aren&#39;t all born with music in our souls, we can&#39;t all write great literature, some of us have two left feet, and quite a few programmers should be in another line of work.

2. Some big software programs flopped, and the wrong conclusions were drawn: that failure was due to non-compliance with process. Process is a useful tool, but it isn&#39;t magic. Big programs would be more succcessful if they employed genuine repetitive rapid prototyping, but the finance guys don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s too risky.

3. Finance realized that if you let programmers talk directly to customers, they were likely to go off and make improvements without charging for them. To prevent this, firewalls were built between customers and programmers. The problem is that the cross-firewall communication channels usually have a low SNR.

I could not possibly agree with the Agile Manifesto more. Now, let&#39;s make it happen!<hr>

<b>Milosz Bazela</b>:  (Stepstone Solutions) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:raghu171977@gmail.com">Raghavendra Raichur</a>: I worked on waterfall,V model, ASAP and Agile as many others. But i found the agile is more promising than the rest. You see the developement of the product/project, fix defects the as soon as it is introduced. Hence at the start of system testing , lot of defects are removed. So now my test team can test more thoroghly to identify complex defects. Since I came from testing background and I talk more about testing.  <hr>
<b>Rupa Sharma</b>: I have worked on traditional as well as Agile way of software projects. I really appreciate the way, Agile promotes &quot;Real work&quot; rather than &quot;paper work&quot; and ensures product delivery along with customer&#39;s satisfaction. I feel implementing Agile framework is not the main challenge but what we need is the change in our mindset. <hr>
<a href="mailto:linkedin@drealm.info">Peter L Jones</a>:  (<a href="http://www.drealm.info">http://www.drealm.info</a>) People write software and getting it right means knowing what &quot;right&quot; is, which means collaborating with the customer - even when they change what they need.  Deliver early, deliver often and deliver a working product - enough to make your customers want to keep going.  &quot;Agile&quot; encapsulates this philosophy and I&#39;m more than happy to endorse its manifesto.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rick@procom-sis.com">Rick Jenness</a>:  (Procom System Integration Solutions) The Agile Manifesto represent core values derived from years of failure by highly skilled and well meaning individuals and organizations….  Years of experience learning what NOT TO DO and what DOESN’T WORK when developing software.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ciprian_dragoi@yahoo.com">Ciprian Dragoi</a>: Agile Manifesto is the begining of a great story which proves that software organizations can produce more value if they change the mind set.<hr>

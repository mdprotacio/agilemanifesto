<a href="mailto:chrislesage@hotmail.com">Chris Lesage</a>: Agile is the only way of developing software for me that worked.

Perhaps the reason is, contrary to people&#39;s beliefs, not all developers are geeks who like to work alone.

But many of them would like to work in an open, social atmosphere were things are getting done!<hr>

<a href="mailto:alfredo.pulla@it.ibm.com">Alfredo Pulla</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>) At IBM today there are a growing number of organizations and teams working to deliver products and services using Agile and iterative development approaches. These approaches include methods, processes, and techniques such as Open Unified Process (OpenUP), Lean software development, and Agile techniques using Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and others. Teams are finding that they can mix and match techniques to create tailored development processes and procedures that improve value for clients, projects, accounts, individuals, organizations, and so on.<hr>

<a href="mailto:nasimrassi@gmail.com">Daniel Mora</a>: After eight years working using conventional development mode, the last year me and my team have started using the scrum methodology and agile principles, Test First Programing, Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration and in less than a year we have getting the better results ever.<hr>
<b>Peter Fornai</b>: There is no doubt in my mind about the importance of the Agile Manifesto.<hr>

<b>Jim Wilson</b>:  (<a href="http://www.jimwilsonblog.com/">WilQuest (Hong Kong), Ltd</a>) Having worked on a broad assortment of applications across various industries, I have found that agile methodologies are always more effective than traditional waterfall-like processes.  Today&#39;s information consumer has constantly changing requirements and may not know what they need in an end-sate solution until they see it in a working application.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:cchitwoodjr@gmail.com">Carl Chitwood Jr.</a>:  (<a href="http://phaseonecg.com">Phase One Consulting Group</a>) Working in one of the least &quot;Agile&quot; markets, the Federal Government, I have witnessed the huge return that implementing Agile philosophies bring to an organization over time. Especially organizations like most in government where they have a set budget for maintaining and enhancing a system over time. Utilizing both Kanban and Scrum, sometimes on the same program, has increased customer satisfaction and stakeholder transparency on every project we have implemented it on to date. I personally will not return to Waterfall if I can help it. <hr>
<b>Dan Hoehnle</b>: In a customer oriented market, Agile processes are the only way to meet client demand in time frame that is relevant to the client. Problems that exist now need to be solved now not a year from now. Close collaboration with the client ensures that the clients greatest needs are met first and allows development teams to quickly adjust to changing needs of the client.<hr>

<a href="mailto:bkotireddy@gmail.com">Koti Reddy Bhavanam</a>: Agile Manifesto, simply amazing by just not believing but also following. Being agile is more important than thinking doing agile.<hr>
<b>Vamsi Chada</b>:  (PDX) The manifesto is the future of software development and brings in more value rather than traditional and outdated process oriented methodologies.<hr>

<a href="mailto:jmcdonald@entry.com">John McDonald</a>:  (<a href="http://www.entry.com">Entry Software Corporation</a>) I love this.  At the core are values around service, community, and integrity.<hr>

<b>John Gnotek</b>:  (<a href="http://www.JohnGnotek.com">CyberAlley ~ New Media</a>) <td width="233"><b>Ryan Hartzog</b>: I have spent my career learning how to be a better software engineer. Taking my craft personally and wanting to make better the science of creating software.  I fight the good fight in order to leave behind better products than when I arrived.<hr>
<a href="mailto:michael.odwyer@tyrecheck.com">Michael O'Dwyer</a>:  (<a href="http://www.tyrecheck.com">TyreCheck</a>) We work with large organisations and have employed the &#39;people over processes&#39; as the key ingredient in our development methodology.  We have delivered more with greater acceptance in a fraction of the time and costs.<hr>

<b>Tom Pascarella</b>:  (<a href="http://www.mediatek.com">Mediatek</a>) Agile itself is a newer, best-of-breed collection of methodologies used to develop and maintain software. And as a technical communication and enterprise content management specialist, I see it applying to these areas as well.<hr>
<a href="mailto:iappleyard@gmail.com">Ivonne Appleyard</a>: Working with the Agile Manifesto really puts the customer requirements in the driving seat.
It is values individuals, team working and constant review of the value of changes throughout the development.<hr>
<b>Manjit Singh</b>:  (<a href="http://www.Agilious.com">Agilious LLC</a>) I endorse the Agile Manifesto 100%!

I can personally vouch for Agile processes being a practitioner since 2000 starting with XP.

Love it and evangelize it professionally all the time!

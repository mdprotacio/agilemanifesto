<b>Paul Kvamme</b>: I have witnessed Agile and adaptive teams deliver projects that more completely satisfy and delight the customer, simply because the customer saw progress, which allowed them to continue supporting the development.  The customer is satisfied.  The management is satisfied.  The developers are not burned out and can take pride in what they have developed.

And the product does exactly what it was designed to do.<hr>
<a href="mailto:max.raul@gmail.com">Max Cruz</a>.<hr>
<b>Juan de Villiers</b>:  (SyllogisTeks) Implementing agile processes, although challenging, has been extremely rewarding.  The team members have greater freedom and the software delivered has been very pleasing to the customers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:luis.torres@2towers.com.br">Luis Fernando Torres</a>:  (<a href="http://www.2towers.com.br">2Towers: Training and Technologies</a>) Agile has many application as any other methodology but, more focused in people instead of process. Agile is client-driven instead of result. The result should add value to client instead only result. Agile should fill a blank that project management has been calling scope creep, Agile is the right size for that!  <hr>
<b>Daniel Swid</b>: I agree and endorse the manifesto. <hr>
<b>Sanjay Vamja</b>:  (<a href="http://www.maxbohr.com">Max Bohr</a>) Agile is liberation of mind over rules. It is not for those who fear. It is for those who deter to give their best and comes out with miracles!<td width="233"><a href="mailto:sbanerjee.usa@gmail.com">Sharmila Banerjee</a>.<hr>

<a href="mailto:mariohaza@yahoo.com.mx">Mario Haza</a>: I have always believed that the software development process should be done on small chunks on timing; right now the ever changing situations must be attained regularly, not at the final stage of a monolithical vision<hr>

<a href="mailto:dan.gower@me.com">Dan Gower</a>: As a freelance Digital Project Manager, I endorse the principles of Agile. Why? Because allowing developers/designers/clients (and ultimately the project) to follow the path of least resistance, with the emphasis on &quot;working&quot; iterations simply makes more sense. Given that anything we build is going to change, during and after deployment, Agile is the only sensible way to work.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sbonacorsi@islss.com">Steven Bonacorsi</a>:  (<a href="http://www.islss.com">International Standard for Lean Six Sigma</a>) I have been applying the Agile Methods since 2001, when I first signed the Manifesto. I regret I was traveling when asked by Jim Highsmith to join the first Agile Meeting, but kudos to all the initial members for sharing best practices, and helping to mature software development model. As the President of the International Standard for Lean Six Sigma, I am excited to see the non-value add waste removed from the software model and a focus on the daily delivery of working software that has been developed with customer collaboration.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dandrade.jose@gmail.com">José D'Andrade</a>: I&#39;d say I have been working this way since the first time successful visual development tools were available (1991). In my case, it all started because I wanted to satisfy customers 100%. So, constant several times a day communication became part of my way of doing things. I became used to constant changes, working prototypes and involving the customer in the process. I am glad to join and support.<hr>
<b>Chris Farrell</b>: Full support and commitment. Changes the way we think, work and succeed. Happy (upcoming) Birthday!<hr>
<b>Norberto L. Herz</b>:  (<a href="http://nohorbee.com.ar">http://nohorbee.com.ar</a>) As an IT professional, I found and find in Agile methodologies a differential methodology that not only makes my teams to work more efficiently, but also, more relaxed and happy.
I have been working with several methodologies with different purposes.
As a team leader turning into Scrum Master, I found in Scrum an incredible way to manage requirements and project life-cycle.
As an IT Architect, I found AMDD a wonderful technique and method to construct solutions in a changing environment.
As a Developer, I found TDD, and XP an exceptional way to fulfill the requirements-&gt;user stories-&gt;tasks.<hr>

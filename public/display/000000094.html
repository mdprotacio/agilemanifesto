Agile makes business sense

Agility is a business requirement. Customers want fast response to their needs and businesses need a way to meet these needs.<hr>
<a href="mailto:stangi@intense.co.in">Srinivas Tangirala</a>:  (<a href="http://www.intense-technologies.com">Intense Technologies Limited</a>) I am thrilled and excited that being a PM of about 50+ developers the methodologies that I adopted six years back (we were 3 at that time), the way of working etc., totally fall in line with Agile Manifesto and its principles. 

I heard about agile software development (2 years ago) but did not know what it really meant.  Now I understand it and embrace it whole heartedly and I would like to do something on my part to promote and bring awareness of this revolutionary way of development.

End of the day, the travails and excitement we as a team go through and many a time celebrate our success - the means of achievement matters to me the most! 

Cheers

<b>Veena Rao</b>:  (IGS Energy) The agile manifesto supports team building by default. It is a given, in the process and that is why I like it!

I also like the fact that developers get to do what they like to do, without spending too much time in documentation.

Recently had someone tell me a cloient of theirs thought the Manifesto was &quot;content free&quot; since anybody would be in favor of what it said.  Of course, being &quot;in favor of&quot; something is a long way from doing something about it.<hr>

<b>Fabio Mattei</b>:  (<a href="http://www.nopress.it">Nopress</a>) Forse è strano trovare il commento in italiano di un programmatore ma credo che il limite dei popoli anglsassoni sia il loro linguaggio. Non potranno mai apprezzare la bellezza di una lingua come la mia.
Ad ogni modo sono un programmatore agile da un bel pezzo, da quando sono entrato nel fantastico mondo di Ruby on Rails.
Mi ha sconvolto la vita Ringrazio tutti i programmatori della comunità, grazie a loro il mio lavoro è migliorato tantissimo!<hr>

<a href="mailto:miroslav.benesovsky@cz.ness.com">Miroslav Benešovský</a>:  (NESS Czech) excelent idea. Some people (fundamental methodoligist)hide their inability to devise anything by insisting on methodology advices.
But some principles are not only dependant on developers and require acceptance by customers, managers etc. What with that?<hr>

<b>John Coughlin</b>: I have followed, wherever possible, the principles outlined in the manifesto.  I was doing this before anyone ever heard of agile programming.  My stylle has  gotten me in trouble and I had a reputation in some places, but I always found that the software itself had a call to me that could not be answered by established process.  I always produced software that made the customer take notice, but, strangely enough, the good opinion of the customer cannot always save you, under the traditional process of software development.<hr>

<a href="mailto:stacykanan@gmail.com">Stacy Kanan</a>:  (<a href="http://stacykanan.blogspot.com/">http://stacykanan.blogspot.com/</a>) In the last year, I asked a close renown colleague to &quot;educate me on Agile&quot;.  The response was that I didn&#39;t know what I was asking because I had been &quot;doing it for years&quot;.    What I learned was that I had, in fact, been doing it because I had utilized what I had researched as a graduate student (long before the advent of anything more than a waterfall SDLC)--adapt to fit the project (type of project, resources on the project, etc).  And, projects have demanded that people, communication, working software, a happy customer, and managed change be put first in order for a project to be successful.  I only hope that Agile will grow in use more rapidly!<hr>

It really is so much simpler and fun. 

Like sitting around the fire a Friday evening 11,283 years ago hashing out: moose hunt? Salmon fishing? Or a potlatch with the coastals?

And let&#39;s make it the best yet.

Delighted. Count me in.

<a href="mailto:steve@clearlyinventory.com">Steve Lochmoeller</a>:  (<a href="http://www.clearlyinventory.com">Clearly Inventory</a>) We&#39;ve been using the Agile Software Development methodology before we even knew what it was called!

<a href="mailto:akshatpaul@gmail.com">Akshat Paul</a>:  (<a href="http://techleap.blogspot.com/">http://techleap.blogspot.com/</a>) I am a fan of awe-inspiring agile software methodologies like Scrum, FDD, XP. They help me reaching my ultimate goal everyday that is keeping my clients happy, and they&#39;re happy coz we bring them one step closer to cheap changes. Improve quality and pace of work for peers. Challenging ourself everyday coz no matter how simple this cure sounds its complex in implementation, but it is something to learn all the time.    <hr>

Open to problems, focussed in solutions using the potential of the individuals, accepting not know everything and being therefore a more flexible: Companies, that&#39;s the way! <hr>

<b>Dan Merriman</b>: Einstein&#39;s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

Traditional methods are failing repeatedly, a new approach is long overdue. That approach is Agile.<hr>

<b>Dayn Jackson</b>:  (Raytheon IIS) Employed several of the agile methods in the execution of a 2.5 year development effort, which had very volitile requirements and the agile approach worked! I could not fathom how we would have been successful given the customer requirements volitility and interim compressed schedules had we followed more traditional methods.<hr>

<a href="mailto:reply2naren@hotmail.com">Narendran Sivakumar</a>: I totally agree with the Agile Manifesto.
It gives us the freedom to develop the software in a creative way with lot of colloboration with the team and with the customer.
Documentation has always been a pain in the wrong places :-). A good programmer knows how to give meaningful names to variables, methods etc, hence makes it readable for other real programmers.

Long live Agile!!!!

After becoming a Certified Scrum Master and practicing my craft, I fully endorse the Agile Manifesto. Success rates are much higher and my customers are happier for it! <hr>
<a href="mailto:glenn@glennfriesen.com">Glenn Friesen</a>:  (<a href="http://glennfriesen.com/">Glenn Friesen</a>) I have been living by the agile manifesto for years, and fully support it. Agility in process! Self-Organization! These are my battle cries. <hr>

<a href="mailto:jwillson@dssltd.com">John Willson</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dssltd.com">DSS Ltd.</a>) Successful projects are architecture driven to exceed customer/client satisfaction with high software quality craftmanship.  Until the world acquires thought to software, agile and its variants is the way to capture requirements, exceed expectations, and measure progress.<hr>

<b>Jocson, A. G.</b>: I&#39;m using Agile Methodology in all my projects and those projects are successfull either small, medium to large scale projects. I&#39;m continuesly studying, developing and improving the details of this methodology, tailored for specific organiztional needs.<hr>

<a href="mailto:agility@elasticprovisioner.com">Asher Bond</a>:  (<a href="http://asherbond.com">Elastic Provisioner, Inc.</a>) Success is 99% failure and probably almost 1% knowing when to quit. Iterative practices designed by project, innovation, and engineering focused field experts who share information from past failures in a way that leverages past experience for a greater good are the characteristics which make project stakeholders realize the difference between the inefficient &quot;fire-fighting&quot; modes by which they used to operate and the innovation an Agile methodologist brings to the team and to the table. Even in a time of realizing elastic provision, and even with the immensely measurable impact of Agile methodologies... we have only begun to realize how much the Agile movement has shaped the innovative software which remains usable today. With this software, which has become a toolbox for the future, and with the innovation gained by the Agile project framework... we have been provided not just a toolbox with instructions, but the scientific ability to build a &quot;tunnel&quot; of test-driven and quality-assured collaboration beneath the once hyper-departmentalized walls of confusion. Collaboration is like competition on steroids and the interactive individual is the smallest, most highly flexible component in any organization. It may seem to the inefficient individual as if this is the end of their job security, but for those who practice innovation from cradle to grave this is only the beginning of what we can achieve for our customers and stakeholders. This is only the beginning.

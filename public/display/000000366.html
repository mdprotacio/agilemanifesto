<b>M. Imran Javed</b>:  (Fauji Foundation Pakistan) The Manifesto is more focused towards individual or customer satisfaction. Good to have this approach but somehow we also need to focus on processes, documentation, negotiations and plans to end up with something.<hr>
<b>Stephen Angell</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:pkojovic@gmail.com">Petar Kojović</a>.<hr>
<b>Deepak D Rao</b>: Agile is best method for Software development for faster and working software to the customer.<hr>
<a href="mailto:greg@gjhebert.com">Gregory J. Hebert</a>:  (GJ Hebert Consulting) I have used the principles of this manifesto in my work and life endeavors since 1968.  As a project manager, I take the role of servant-leader, helping my team members seek and implement solutions and removing impediments to success.<hr>
<a href="mailto:hernan.spika@sanofi.com">Hernán Spika</a>:  (Sanofi Aventis) <hr>
<b>Aaron Terrell</b>: Regardless of the specific Agile philosophy a single team may follow, the core principles are critical in building mindful, self-sufficient teams or broader organizations that work well with their stakeholders for the betterment of the world. Thank you to those that in the past articulated the characteristics of the method, to those that practice and continue to improve it today, and to those that will do so tomorrow.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kate.e.engel@bigpond.com">Kate Engel</a>: Agile for me is now the norm to the point where I don&#39;t actually consider myself an Agile practitioner anymore. I&#39;m just a delivery lead making common sense decisions based on a common sense approach.  <hr>
<b>Alex Gouges</b>:  (Thales Australia) In the past I had thought that only some of the manifesto and its principles truly captured what I understood to be &quot;Agile&quot;, believing that parts were dated and out of touch with the realities of doing business.

I can&#39;t believe I got it so wrong. I guess some things you just need to experience for yourself.<hr>
<b>Javier A. Sanz</b>: Agile is the best method to avoid the dehumanization of the system.<hr>
<b>Ammar Yasir</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sen.baris@yahoo.com">Baris Sen</a>.<td width="233"><b>Gaurav Puri</b>:  (QASource Pvt. Ltd.) Agile focuses on work element and sidelines the extra things. It helps individuals to self sustain and manage themselves. Everyone is an individual leader in Agile.<hr>
<b>Firial </b>:  (SNCF) Project Manager <hr>
<b>Angel Diaz-Maroto Alvarez</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:gary@adduco.digital">Gary Worthington</a>:  (Adduco Digital Ltd) <hr>
<a href="mailto:vasudevan.srinivasan@tcs.com">Vasudevan Srinivasan</a>:  (TCS) Agile principles are apt for a healthy work life and a rationale way to tackle change. 

If you trust and empower people, they will be confident enough to manage the change and brave enough to try new things and trump that change. 

These principles are a true reflection of that trust.<hr>
<a href="mailto:fadelgado@gmail.com">Fabio Delgado</a>:  (Prodigious Brand Logistics) <hr>
<b>Tassos Koutlas</b>: I endorse the agile manifesto and the 12 underlining principles. I believe that project delivery should follow agile as close as possible and promote continuous software delivery from self-organising teams.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jmboulet1@yahoo.ca">Jean Michel Boulet</a>:  (MediSolution) As an early adopter and true industrial use of Spiral methodology back in early 1990&#39;s within 4GL RAD tools, I believe Agile way of (business) life is the currently state of the art in term of product delivery. I support and promote this clever Agile manifesto definition the best I can.<hr>
<b>Tim Gierach</b>:  (Self employed) <hr>
<a href="mailto:Hopemankind@gmail.com">Hope Mogale</a>:  (Mankind Inc) <hr>
<a href="mailto:david@bletchley.us">David M Phillips</a>:  (Bletchley Park Advisors, LLC) Despite--and because of--a couple decades of indoctrination in bulky project management and software development methods, Agile has been remarkably intuitive. Agile requires partnership and accountability from both development teams and their customers, as well as a champion for their collective success, not a bean counter or a nanny.<hr>
<b>Ron Vest</b>:  (Trinity Logistics) Software development the way it should be!<hr>

The way I used to work on a new business development team ( non IT) back in late 90s and early 2000s. We made lots of progress and learned lots!! Excited about helping others do this as a Scrum Master and Product Owner !!<hr>
<b>Sukanto Mukherjee</b>:  (TCS) Agile is a natural mindset. Knowingly or unknowingly we all follow Agile methodology. The IT industry itself teaches us to be Agile.
When I came to know about Agile I had already executed projects as Business Analyst by adopting agile perspective.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sapanturkar@gmail.com">Sapan Turkar</a>: By far the most correct way to build long term softwares<hr>
<a href="mailto:paul.aneja@pse.com">Paul Aneja</a>:  (PSE) Have used Agile in architecture to blend the best of both Agile and Architecture practices. Lot to be gained by complementary practices and finding good blended approaches. <hr>

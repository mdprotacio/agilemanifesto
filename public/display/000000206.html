<a href="mailto:BurggraafSE@ldschurch.org">Sam Burggraaf</a>:  (LDS Church) Establishing clear values are important for any organization&#39;s efforts to be successful. The values of the Manifesto provide clear direction and focus to our development and service support efforts, while allowing us to develop our own agile models and methods to meet the needs of our customers. These Manifesto values have stood the &quot;test of time&quot; in our large project software development and in our service operations.<hr>

<a href="mailto:edward.j.thomas@npmanagement.org">Ed Thomas</a>: It is so very important for us to revisit this Manifesto from time to time. All too often I encounter folks who think Agile is: having standups, moving post-it notes around on a board, treating planning as if it is completely irrelevant and documentation as entirely unnecessary. For them, contract negotiation is something for others to think about, and any tool utilized before Agile became popular is old &amp; useless.  The authors of the Manifesto did not &quot;throw the baby out with the bathwater&quot;.  They stated priorities with which I agree, and have long incorporated into my practice. As one who values and respects people &amp; their abilities to contribute, I support the Manifesto as a central theme in the field of Project Management<hr>

<a href="mailto:majid.x.iqbal@gmail.com">Majid Iqbal</a>: In a world where &quot;software = service&quot; we should adopt Agile for the design and development of world-class services, in business, government, and non-profit. 

Agile development can help organizations realize that services are in fact a type of product.  <hr>

<a href="mailto:vinojbc@gmail.com">Vinoj</a>:  (amdocs) <td width="233"><b>Bertrand FLORAT</b>:  (IT Consultant) Agile benefits are proved, we delivered all our projects in time using Scrum.<hr>
<b>Joao Bettencourt, PMP</b>:  (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=80466503&locale=en_US&trk=tab_pro">Software project management</a>) Agile has allowed our teams to escape the vicious cycle of long development phases which frequently were wasted by drastic shifts in scope. Now, when a large scope shift occurs, we lose a lot less prior effort. <hr>
<b>John Riley</b>:  (<a href="http://www.erudine.com">Erudine Ltd</a>) Applying these principles is the only way forward, especially in our complex, fast changing world. Waterfall has had its day.

For the next 10 years we mustn&#39;t underestimate the task of deploying agile in the corporate enterprise environment. The technology is key, of course, but so is the huge mindset change required in the enterprise, especially by business people, as agile approaches require a major rethink in corporate structures - procurement, contracts, business models, outcomes, user interaction. <hr>
<b>Marc Strohlein</b>:  (<a href="http://www.agilebusinesslogic.com">Agile Business Logic</a>) A firm believer in, and user of agile tenets and principles. My new endeavor is applying the principles to a broader business framework.<hr>
<b>Ari Harrison</b>: I endorse the values and goals of the Agile Manifesto. It is my belief, that only through a process of improved and increased collaboration and communication based on team principles will the software development process become better and more able to deal with the product owners needs. The agile process can also be leveraged outside of the software development space, and can be a great benefit to any organization.<hr>
<b>Viktor Farcic</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:gauravatnet@gmail.com">Gaurav Gaur</a>: Processes kills valuable time of a developer. There should be a right balance for everything. No process and no documentation both don&#39;t work out well.

But a tilt towards agility is much more developer friendly and a happy developer can do wonders!

I support agility, value customer, understand change and engage everyone!<hr>

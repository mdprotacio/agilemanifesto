It&#39;s a pitty, that the ideas are often misunderstood by managers and customers.<hr>

<b>Mz Omarjee</b>:  (Standard Bank Group - South Africa) Agile development practices has proven itself to be a success almost in every way. An agile strategy can alleviate many of a software project&#39;s intricate an unknown complexities early in the development process. In our organization, Pervasive(Mobile and Voice Banking) software solutions were implemented using agile approaches, resulting in project delivery on time, within budget, and more importantly meeting all requirements.
      
Finally, the Agile principles is analogus to a constitution. If an enterprise believes in it , its entire domain - business, IT, logistics and operations will flourish. <hr>

<b>George Dinwiddie</b>:  (<a href="http://idiacomputing.com/">iDIA Computing, LLC</a>) I don&#39;t know why it never occurred to me to add my name to this list before.

<a href="mailto:mark.naude@bigfoot.com">Mark Naudé</a>: This is a welcome approach, and it&#39;s pleasing to find other like-minded persons.  I work in the pharmaceutical environment, where GAMP holds sway, and am - slowly - changing minds concerning the slow, waterfall-type approach espoused by GAMP.  This will be a useful addition to the arsenal.<hr>

<b>sharad hegde</b>:  (Bear ) I started experimenting with Agile methodologies after reading Kent Beck&#39;s seminal book on Xtreme programming. 
Since then, I haven&#39;t looked back. I have used different doses and flavors of it depending upon the situation and constraints.

<a href="mailto:theonion@cox.net">Rocky Smith</a>:  (<a href="http://www.perfectschedule.com/">PerfectSchedule.com</a>) I love agile development because it&#39;s natural and the emphasis is on delivering an amazing product to satisfy a customer, not a piece of paper. Developers who justify their crappy software by stating it &quot;meets the requirements&quot; are only justifying the need for this development process.<hr>

<b>Fernanda Menezes</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:Ghen.j@163.com">Ghen Jiang</a>:  (<a href="http://www.huawei.com">Huawei (IT co. from China)</a>) I have worked for several companies. And Huawei Technologies is the biggest and famous, but when we reached the CMM level 5, and prepared for CMMI level 4, we found the ability of the software development is not very good actually, the documents so heavy and useless, just document for document, not for the project aims.

Agile, the balance of the CMM and the undefined, give us more hopeful. When I having worked around developer, tester, QA, I felt the Agile was very power for including a variety of area knowledge, such as project management,human resource management, technical and so on.

Thank you, Agile!<hr>

<b>Edward San Pedro</b>: Fostering an environment that promotes continuous change is rooted in trust. We can only have that with teamwork.

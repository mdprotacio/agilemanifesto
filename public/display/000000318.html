So once again:

Seeing Agile way of working and specifically Scrum being proved in a high performance mostly self steering team (not reached the ultimate goal yet) ;-).
It&#39;s powerful and mind blowing if you see that state of team performance following the agile principles.  
I try to apply these every day at work and spread them around.
Thanks!

<b>Jerry Chaves</b>:  (<a href="http://www.imf.org">IMF</a>) It&#39;s been a good 4 years since I first heard of Agile, and so far it&#39;s one of the guiding principles that has served me well, not only through numerous development efforts, but in later projects involving pure implementation and infrastructure improvement. Hopefully it&#39;ll serve the general community further in the future.<hr>

Therefor I couldn&#39;t agree more with the Agile Manifesto.<hr>

<b>Mridul Jayan</b>: For personal experience in IT projects of almost a decade, agile works. It is more of like an interface where you can customize your implementation rather than adher to archaic practices infused with red-tape and documentation hell.<hr>

<b>Leon Steyns</b>: I support the Agile Manifesto! Not only for software development, but if I am allowed to do so - also in a wider(business) perspective. To that means, I read the second statement:
&quot;Working systems over comprehensive documentation&quot;<hr>

<b>Brandon West</b>:  (427781) I believe and agree with the purpose and intent of the Agile Manifesto.  Too many hours, days and cumulative months are spent in meetings spinning wheels for proof of progress.  The progress should be in the deliverable.  <hr>

<b>J Ted Stamps</b>: I embrace the advantages of Agile, especially how it embodies the goals of classical management but achieves those goals with new approaches and renewed emphasis on customer satisfaction.  Additionally, I love the gestalt of including the product team (and their happiness/satisfaction) as an important piece of the overall product life cycle&#39;s deliverables.  Better products, happier customers, and happier workers: Agile can be a win win win. <hr>
<b>Ian Mitchell Kostman</b>:  (<a href="http://www.nemo-soft.com">Nemo-Soft Business Solutions</a>) I have been developing hardware, software, and systems for nearly 30 years. When I was asked if I knew what Agile Development was, I have to admit I was perplexed.  That was, of course, until I found this site... thank goodness common sense and good business practice are so in Vogue now that it has an actual name.

I have always conducted myself in this manner, and have made a point of passing it on to everyone I have taught, trained, led, or employed. Nice to see it has caught on like wildfire.

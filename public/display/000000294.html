<a href="mailto:s.raman@ramantech.com">Sanjeev Raman</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ramantech.com">Raman Technologies, Inc</a>) Its all about making the customer happy and confident in the work you are doing. Knowing that the customer can make changes at any time, you need a methodology/framework that is adaptive and in some cases reactive.<hr>

<b>Tony Kenny</b>:  (<a href="http://www.haybrooke.com">Haybrooke Associates Ltd</a>) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:michele_zambon@libero.it">Michele Zambon</a>:  (Manager and senior Project Manager IT) Traditional software development is based too often on archaic principles, functional analyzes that once completed is already obsolete, etc. ... the development must be based on time windows reduced at the end of which the entire project team, including users, analyze the product released and the changing needs of business in the meantime can be changed, due to external factors such as new regulatory requirements or simply changing needs and business opportunities.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mgmmclaugh119@yahoo.com">Michael G. McLaughlin</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>) I have seen Agile software development methodology and Scrum practice turn organizations around and drastically improve productivity and quality. I&#39;m a believer in Agile and promote it when ever possible.<hr>
<b>Mike Austin</b>:  (<a href="http://www.TestPrepSupport.com">TestPrep Media</a>) Agile follows the principles of developing and testing in iterations rather than as a whole product.  This process can help minimize overall risk and allows the project to adapt to changes quickly.<hr>
<b>Andy Morley</b>:  (<a href="http://www.magneticnorth.com">Magnetic North</a>) I think this is a great idea, any developments in the software industry are always welcome.<hr>
<b>Bert Damsma</b>:  (CapGemini) I believe that the world as we know it is not created by a precooked plan with 7 fases but by continuous adaptation to change with daily iterations.<hr>
<b>Carlo Barbaro</b>:  (<a href="http://it.linkedin.com/in/carlobarbaro/">http://it.linkedin.com/in/carlobarbaro/</a>) Planning is often a lie which everyone pretends to believe but everyone knows that will not represent the reality in the development of a project<hr>

<b>Ángel J. Ramos</b>.<td width="233"><b>Stephen Graves</b>:  (<a href="http://StephenGraves.us">http://StephenGraves.us</a>) When I studied martial arts under a student of Bruce Lee, I was told &quot;Strength means nothing without speed and the only way to be fast is to be completely relaxed, instantly available to adapt to any situation.&quot; That&#39;s Agile. The core concepts of customer-led product development, continuous feedback loops, transparency, cross-functionality and accountability are critical to succeeding in rapid change.<hr>
<a href="mailto:skuncham@yahoo.com">Sudhakar Kuncham</a>: I strongly believe the Agile iterative methodology is a better process than Traditional waterfall Methodology (PMBOK, PRINCE2...). Agile is a transparent process across all the participating teams and investors.<hr>
<a href="mailto:pak.youngrok@gmail.com">Pak Youngrok</a>:  (<a href="http://youngrok.com">ecolemo</a>) Read Agile Manifesto before getting retrospective time. It helps.<hr>

<b>Peter Carlsson</b>:  (Liteolika) <hr>
<b>Praveen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.icicletech.com">Ruby on Rails Development</a>) We have been using Agile for building products for large number of startups. Teams are as small as 3 to as large as 15. 

The kind of innovation, speed and trust would not have been possible if not for Agile processes and the tools built on that. 

Highly endorse this process and recommend this for all startups.<hr>

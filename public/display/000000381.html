<a href="mailto:kbtripathi@gmail.com">Kamal Tripathi</a>: I have been working at big banks on wall street since 1999. Lately have seen a major sift from waterfall methodology to Agile and its really reshaping how wall street does business. Big fan of Agile methodology<hr>

<a href="mailto:joe_goldberg@bmc.com">Joe Goldberg</a>:  (BMC Software Inc.) It takes only a single project to be convinced. Try it. You have only frustration and disappointment to lose and a world of satisfaction to gain.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jmguillemette@gmail.com">Jamie Guillemette</a>: Software development needs to focus on what matters. This is more about the requirements, design and deliverable and less about the process and needless documentation.<hr>

<b>David A Ostrander</b>: Reusability is the product of good design… Thank you to the progenitors of this movement and like-minded professionals for your cogent contributions towards rationality, despite perpetual chaos!<td width="233"><a href="mailto:alicesheng8@gmail.com">Alice Sheng</a>: I have seen the agile manifesto work in teams and organizations, both explicitly and through pure natural shifts of doing things better. <hr>
<b>Oliver M. Meyer</b>.<hr>
<b>Fionnuala Hendrick</b>:  (Ci Labs) I have worked in Companies with both strong and weak Agile processes in place. I have found where working agile processes are in place - the environment is  a fun and rewarding place to work, while environments with partial agile processes are generally dysfunctional and stressful environments to work in <hr>

<a href="mailto:ktate@griffintate.com">Karen Tate, PMP, MBA, PMI Fellow</a>:  (The Griffin Tate Group, Inc.) The Agile Manifesto, like many great documents, has contributed to improvements in focusing on what&#39;s important, instead of working to satisfy rigid requirements that do not improve user value.<hr>
<b>Todd Royal</b>.<hr>
<b>Milind A. Joshi</b>: I have come from a different way of doing things, and I&#39;ve done &quot;agile&quot; for several years, getting most things wrong at first, then getting a few things right, and steadily increasing that percentage. All projects benefit, team morale increases, customers are happier, and costs are predictable. As with all things truly innovative, Agile seems &quot;obvious&quot; in hindsight, but it is easier said than done.<hr>
<b>Stuart Burchill</b>: These straight-forward statements of the Manifesto have all the power to transform an organization if taken to heart and given the opportunity to be absorbed and followed. The statements are timeless and form a simple focal point to guide all Agile activities<hr>

<a href="mailto:aravind.sr@gmail.com">Aravind Ravichandran</a>:  (Bank of America) Being Agile<td width="233"><a href="mailto:duane.wilkins@gmail.com">Duane Wilkins</a>:  (Department of Conservation) Agile is a fantastic way to engage as a team, and I really like how the business is an integral part of the project. While its not for everyone, I would encourage everyone to give it a try.<hr>
<b>Stephen Sharp</b>: I endorse the Agile Manifesto!  Its an intuitive, logical, and human approach to product development. <hr>
<a href="mailto:pattrick.brobeck@franklin.edu">Patrick Brobeck</a>:  (Franklin University & Kirkpatrick Jordan Foundation) Please accept my thanks and endorsement of the documentation and principles of increasingly complex methods that once simplified (the art of maximizing the amount of work not done that delivers beyond customers expectations in direct and tangible result...roi) can be replicated based on the foundating of the method and following the critical path inertia to success.....keep up the good work.

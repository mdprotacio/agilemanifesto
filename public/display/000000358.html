<a href="mailto:brad@epicagile.com.au">Brad Bennett</a>:  (EPiC Agile) 
I have been implementing agile methods, principles &amp; practices since the late 90&#39;s.  And every year and every project I learn more about how to apply &amp; adopt the manifesto to different organisational constructs.

I have been a purist, and a contextual pragmatist, and now I am tribal leader.

<a href="mailto:efthymiou.dimitrios1@gmail.com">Dimitrios Efthymiou</a>: I support the Agile Professionalism in the software-based industries, because it is time for companies to actually give emphasis not only to satisfied customers, but also to the continuous &quot;enlightenment&quot; of the software engineers. Agile is about processes, but definitely, also about engineering proficiency and professionalism (working software).<hr>

<a href="mailto:jeremy@org-eng.com">Jeremy Webb</a>:  (Organizational Engineering) I spent years doing traditional project management and trying to fix the problems the organization was encountering. The more we &quot;fixed&quot; the more problems we created. When I learned about Agile, it just made sense to me. After some study and training, we implemented a Scrum pilot and saw a velocity increase of 250% in 6 months which is rather conservative since our product was also better quality and we did not have testing cycles after development was done. On top of that, everybody was having fun at work.

Agile is not an easy thing for many people and organizations to adopt but it is worth the effort.<hr>

Anybody can be agile if he/she considers Agile manifesto before taking every decision or doing any activity in Agile world. Need to think if decision you are taking is valuing Right side more or Left side more.
Keep practicing it, and you will have agile mindset real quick.<hr>

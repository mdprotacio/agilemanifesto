<b>Tassos Noulas</b>:  (University College London) I don&#39;t know much about programming, but I know that those people are right, because Agile methodology is not only a programming methodology, but it is a natural, logical approach derived by human mind in order to solve problems that their complexity is so big, that the mind cannot cope with it without favoring simplicity and attention to detail. <hr>
<a href="mailto:willbotti@gmail.com">William Botti</a>:  (<a href="http://thq.com">THQ / Relic Entertainment</a>) THQ is the 3rd largest video game publisher and we are using Agile method in a some of our studios, like Relic Entertainment. We are struggling a bit to fit Agile and Scrum Methods into console game development. Interestingly, none of the founding fathers of Agile Manifesto have a games background. I&#39;m interested tweaking the Agile Method for game development by working together with other seasoned game industry professionals.<hr>
<b>Sanjay Kumar Pandey</b>:  (<a href="http://www.hcl.in">HCL Technoligies</a>) It has been the great need of re-accessing the software engineering process and its underlined management style.I feel that Agile methodology proves to be an strong alternatives in today&#39;s context, where all inferfaces(customer, IT, developers,business users and technology leaders) needs to be balanced out effectively and efficiently to make a successfull project.It talks more about people and their related responsibilities rather than technology.I would say people are the real players to make a success or failure.Technology is just a facilitator or secondary.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kmehra1@rediffmail.com">Kunal Mehra</a>: &#39;Change is the only constant during a project life cycle&#39;, So its an attempt to register such changes early.And deliver the product keeping your time lines constant.
Prioritising work is another key issues covered in Agile.<hr>

<b>Hugo Loza</b>:  (JHL Soft.) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:a_gh_bahar@hotmail.com">A.Gh.Bahar</a>: Dear Colleagues.
I think after a period of hesitations, many experts in software field, in practice, have come to these conclusions that you have announced them in your manifesto. I have talked to Mr. Mellor (one of the signatories), about the &quot;heaviness&quot; of some current methodologies and tools in the past. I think most of us, when using any methodology for most of our projects, had to note to our customers, that we have used a &quot;customized&quot; version of the methodology. Now you have gathered all the &quot;pure&quot; of the so-called &quot;best practices in practice!&quot; in software development under a roof as Agile Software Development. Do not forget that when any patient is a new case for a doctor, he/she does not ask his/her patients to do a broad and pre-written list of medical tests. So is with developing software for our customers. I agree with you and I will be very happy if I can to do any thing in this way. A.Gh.Bahar.<hr>

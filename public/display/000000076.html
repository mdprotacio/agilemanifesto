Thinking about what we&#39;re doing and being ready to grasp the essence from the context is what makes this job interesting.<hr>
<a href="mailto:flavit@terra.com.br">Flavio Vit</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ericsson.com">Ericsson</a>) Since the first time I was aware about Agile Methods I became an enthusiast on how to apply those simple and basic principles at my job.<hr>
<b>Leonid Taouz</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:thomas.erickson@lmco.com">Tom Erickson</a>:  (Lockheed Martin) Rigor and agility are not mutually exclusive.  Capability maturity and customer responsiveness are not only compatible but necessary.  Much sweat over the past 50 years has gone into evolving the development of software-intensive systems from a black art to a process-intensive profession, and the pendulum has swung about as far as it can in that direction.  It is time to shine a light on the antipode, and bring the professionalism back to bear on the product.  The Agile Manifesto is such an illumination.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mike.d.jones@lmco.com">Mike Jones</a>:  (Lockheed Martin Aeronautics) Successful software development will always involve iterations of development because requirements capture is never 100% complete with traditional approaches. Agile promotes moving through those iterations faster and as a team to produce usable results sooner for the customer. Early success breeds enthusiasm and high team morale which results in elevated productivity. 

DEATH to the WATERFALL!!!<hr>
<b>Surya</b>: Want to be member of evolving Agile methodology which is more efficient and result oriented process.<hr>
<a href="mailto:claudiusramos@gmail.com">Claudius Souza Ramos</a>:  (Autonomo) I accept this concepts and will make this happen in my work. Its very strong and concise.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jdbandoy@bposerve.com">Joseph A. Bandoy</a>:  (BPO International, Inc.) I think this is the best way to pre-empt the negative effects of Murphy&#39;s Law in software development. Its proactive way of doing things involving all parties to create the software desired is the best working methodology that cuts across any known software development processes.   <hr>
<b>Parag Shah</b>:  (<a href="http://www.adaptivesoftware.biz">Adaptive Software Solutions</a>) The agile manifesto has been made after very clearly understanding the forces that act on a software project. The principles proposed by the manifesto take a very humane and &quot;let&#39;s roll our sleeves and get to work&quot; kind of approach rather than a theoretical approach (that would be difficult to put into practice).<hr>
<b>Johan Söderström</b>:  (<a href="http://www.elva.se">Elva</a>) <hr>
<b>Hla Kyaw (Mr)</b>:  (<a href="http://www.soft-comm.com">SoftComm Technology</a>) Although I studied some information about CMMI processes and applied some of them, I also learn some information about Agile processes and applied some. I appreciate and value both of these processes.

Both of these processes are very knowledgeable depending on different situations.

In some situations, some parts of these processes can be combined, mixed and applied effectively.

For faster software development, Agile Manifesto seems more effective.

<b>Larry S. Dooley</b>: In my 20+ years of software development and design I have seen this industry become more interested in process, bureaucracy and dates than in quality, commitment and customer satisfaction. Agile is the most promising process I have seen since the inception of object orientated design. I am honored to indorse this methodology.<hr>

<b>Nicola Canalini</b>:  (<a href="http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/NicolaCanalini">Quarantadue SaS</a>) &lt;&lt;...Look out the window, not in the mirror.  No matter how successful we are, the world changes faster than our awareness of the change.  Let’s keep our eyes on horizon and act on what we see...&gt;&gt;

The ideas exposed in the AgileManifesto have the &quot;human touch&quot;. I want to work and live in a human world.<hr>
<b>Karen Milligan</b>:  (Capital One) <hr>
<a href="mailto:pejacepoha@yahoo.com">Predrag Jovanovic</a>:  (<a href="http://www.infinite.com.mk">Infinite Solutions</a>) Definitely the Ultimate Software Development Methodology<hr>
<b>Sabin AK</b>:  (<a href="http://www.itti.co.in">iTTi Pvt Ltd.</a>) The habitability priority is an important part of the crystal mind-set. Alistair&#39;s quest (as I see it) is looking for what is the least amount of process you can do and still succeed with an underlying assumption of low-discipline that is inevitable with humans. As a result Alistair sees Crystal as requiring less discipline that extreme programming, trading off less efficiency for a greater habitability and reduced chances of failure.

<a href="mailto:am877@hotmail.com">Amsmams</a>:  (Sinti-Group) I discovered Agile Web development when working with Ruby On Rails...<hr>
<b>Chris Kapilla</b>:  (Kapilla Consulting) It is heartening to learn of a whole movement that is espousing what my own experience in 15+ years of software development and consulting has led me to believe. Well, more than believe, it is simply a matter of direct experience. Flexibility and rapid iterations of working software is where it&#39;s at!<hr>
<b>Jim Allred</b>:  (CS&Co) There is no difference between The Business and IT.<hr>
<a href="mailto:dave_weston@appsig.com">David J. Weston</a>:  (AST) <hr>
<a href="mailto:weeksjm@gmail.com">john Weeks</a>:  (<a href="http://www.djohnne.com">J2EE consultant</a>) If you care about your client these priorities will make themselves evident!<hr>
<a href="mailto:ajennings@csc.com">Alex Jennings</a>:  (<a href="http://www.CSC.com">CSC</a>) A few years back I developed a development methodology based on Lean Design. The core elements are similar to these and I think it&#39;s terrific that you have developed an easy to follow manifesto that people can understand and get behind. Well done. <hr>
<b>Ludovic Blaas</b>:  (Parkeon) <hr>
<a href="mailto:philcya@yahoo.com">Phil Yandel</a>: In my 30+ years, I&#39;ve seen my share of projects fail following traditional methods.  Even those that try to follow newer, iterative methods seem to get caught up in producing the right documentation and CYA materials that the project loses sight of the primary responsibility to producing working business software for our customers.  The Agile movement looks to provide alternatives to these approaches with common sense advice to the many aspects of software development for the professional developer.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mike.sutton@wizewerx.com">Mike Sutton</a>:  (<a href="http://www.wizewerx.com">Wizewerx</a>) This manifesto speaks what I have felt so passionately about and thought I was alone in thinking for the last 10 years!!

Thank you for giving me a voice!<hr>
<a href="mailto:devendra_shinde@yahoo.com">Devendra Shinde</a>:  (OM Software Solutions) I had chance to work on project which had used agile practice. I liked it and would like to get more information and such project to work with.<hr>
<b>Peter Mount</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:Mike_McGarrity@hotmail.com">Michael McGarrity</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dhs.state.mn.us">Minnesota Department of Human Services</a>) I started used the Agile approach with Scrum on the last two software/systems development projects I initiated.

Finding that people of all roles like the inherent efficiencies of clarity, communication, consideration and results the approach brings, I have since applied it to other product development endeavors such as major system software upgrades and Request For Proposal/Contract development.

So much has change been afoot in the last years. To name a few; Agile, BI, CMMI, ECM, ITIL, OPM3, PMBOK, PPM, PRINCE2, SCM,  
Six Sigma, SOA, RUP, W3C. 
Challenges and opportunities of change sometimes seem overwhelming and Agile is good way to bring some stillness and focus together and help people act quickly to take a piece out and see the results, a short feedback loop to adaptation. 
How does a process like this fit or is there value to bring it into Business/IT Strategic Planning? Hmm..A new play think. 
Thanks to the authors of the Manifesto for capturing my sentiments, I have read and learned from many of your works over the years and applied the knowledge in practice. Thanks to fellow signers for contributing.
All the best!

<b>Christian Champenois</b>:  (<a href="http://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca">Héma-Québec</a>) Better software comes from better understanding.

Better project management comes from improved communications skills and direct contact with your team, your sponsors and your customers.

The success of a software project is that people use what you have created not because they have to but because they want to and because they are able to build on it.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jvalkier@jinz.nl">Jeroen Valkier</a>:  (JINZ) Finally, we realize that we&#39;re not building houses, ships, parks or anything alike (no we were not). In the past decades, development of software has suffered too much from such comparisons. To my opinion, the Agile Manifesto is probably the first, comprehensive approach to software development which is practically devoid of these traditional influences. Hurray!Still... it seems we&#39;re just starting.<hr>
<b>John Keith</b>:  (<a href="http://www.kavi.com">Kavi</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:li-zy03@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn">popo</a>: Keep it simple and straight, our life will be easier and happier.<hr>
<b>John Lomnicki</b>:  (<a href="http://www.elcabop.org">ELCA Board of Pensions</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:jlperez@xdsoft.mine.nu">Jose Luis Perez</a>:  (XDSoft) I´ve been (intuitively) trying to follow these principles for years. Now I see there are many others doing the same.
Customer involvement, sometimes hard to achieve, is the cornerstone for good systems, as a combination of human procedures, plus supporting software(or viceversa?)
Thanks for the opportunity to be part of a community sharing such values and practices.<hr>
<b>Kelly Anderson</b>:  (<a href="http://kelly.anderson.name">http://kelly.anderson.name</a>) Wow, I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t signed onto this before. An Agile approach clearly results in happier programmers, more stable code and greater predictability in the process. I do believe this will also eventually result in happier customers and more satisfied management as well. All that being said, the difficulties of implementing an Agile approach within an organization where people&#39;s jobs depend on maintaining the status quo cannot be underestimated.<hr>
<b>Hari Narasimhan</b>.<hr>
<b>Vikram Lashkari</b>:  (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/vikram_lashkari/">http://www.geocities.com/vikram_lashkari/</a>) I feel this alliance has just done and outstanding job,because I think it&#39;s one of the most powerful movements in the past, combining technical excellence with a humane perspective. If we understand that work is not (only) technique but living together with other humans, professional life would be much easier

Hats-off for this alliance<hr>

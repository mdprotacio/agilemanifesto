<a href="mailto:heusserm@student.gvsu.edu">Matthew Heusser</a>:  (<a href="http://www.priority-health.com">Priority Health</a>) <hr>
<b>David Masover</b>: The manifesto supports itself, too, at least in two respects:  It works without having comprehensive documentation, and it is very simple.<hr>
<b>Ananth Balasundaram</b>: This is great stuff.<hr>
<b>Kevin Dooley</b>:  (<a href="http://sf.asu.edu">ASU Software Factory</a>) The ASU Software Factory is a new entity providing professional software development support to ASU researchers.  The Software Factory follows the agile manifesto as its operating philosophy, and conducts rigorous research on agile software engineering.<hr>
<b>Patrick Steyaert</b>:  (ExMeX) <hr>
<a href="mailto:steve.fulton@mattel.com">Steve Fulton</a>:  (<a href="http://www.barbie.com">Mattel Toys</a>) The entire Agile Manifesto and all the Agile princiles apply to the work we perform every day.   We are a highly mobile and agile workgroup dedicated to created the best possible web sites for Mattel branded toys.  We did not even know there wasa nameforthe kind of work we do, until I found Larmann&#39;s Agile Abnd Iterative Development book.  Now it is my bible.  <hr>
<a href="mailto:benoitgodbout@sympatico.ca">Benoit Godbout</a>:  (<a href="http://www.amadeussolutions.com">Amadeus International Inc.</a>) In software development, artefacts (models plans, code etc.) should always be at service of the comprehension and not at the expense of those who produce them. To often individual are slave delivering artefact to the process and not the client, equilibrium is hard to attain.

Agile Software Development Manifesto is the most significant initiative I have seen in this field, yet.  <hr>
<b>Gunnar Eketrapp</b>.<hr>
<b>Arun Bharadwaj</b>: I work for a major IT MNC and have spent a few years in software engineering domain. Of late, I have been a bit weary of the &#39;heavy&#39; processes that are rolled out as organization standards (my role requires me to do that) based on de-facto industry standard models whose ideas germinated about 25-30 years ago. The world has moved a great distance since then (although in many aspects it has been standing almost still, but that&#39;s another story altogether!) but our (software developers&#39;) methods and tools have not kept up with the changes. Mind you I am not deprecating them at all. They made a great deal of sense when they were conceived. They have served their purpose and today we need an approach which I find manifest in ideas on your site. I think the executable model (aka Agile MDA) is a great idea. 

This is my first time on this site. The white paper on Agile MDA on OMG site led me here. And I am glad it did that.<hr>

<b>Ray Massey</b>: Glad to find a group of people supporting a development methodology which has worked for me for years but has traditionally gone against the grain.

<a href="mailto:mailarbhatt@yahoo.com">Aniket R Bhatt</a>: I support the Agile Manifesto<hr>
<a href="mailto:wimcodenie@yahoo.com">Wim Codenie</a>: (Belgium)<td width="233"><a href="mailto:mrwick@bellsouth.net">Matt Wickham</a>:  (<a href="http://www.prorules.com">ProRules</a>) We have incorporated the Agile Manifesto into projects over the last two years in the Business Process Management software field.  The principles behind the manifesto were critical to the succesful implementation of many projects in this rapidly changing field.  The challenge has been in providing structure demanded by the situation and in adapting principles necessary to the application and customer environment.  The founders and leaders in the principles are to be thanked for the continuing evolution of these principles.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Rahulch@microsoft.com">Rahul Chitale</a>:  (Microsoft) Agile metholodogies represent the continuing evolution and finally a credible way to &#39;do&#39; software after getting over the shock that there&#39;s more to software development than simply engineering it.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dlillie@wi.rr.com">David Lillie</a>:  (formerly of Rockwell Software) I am a Development Manager who has used Agile Development techniques in a M$ .Net environment for the past 2 years. Use of open source technology - namely NAnt, Draco, NUnit, and NDoc made this a practical thing to do. Results proved the advantage of Agile compared to the Waterfall model.   <hr>
<b>Adail Muniz Retamal</b>:  (<a href="http://www.heptagon.com.br">Heptagon Tecnologia da Informação Ltda</a>) Brazil is Agile!<hr>
<b>Yousuf Ahmed</b>: The stress on the human factor is what makes this great. I would prefer &#39;Teams&#39; over &#39;Individuals&#39; though.<hr>

<b>Terje Bjørgum</b>:  (Bekk Consulting AS) <hr>
<b>Prescila Amalraj</b>:  (IEEE) I stumbled on this site while reading an online book at the Computer Society web site... I am glad I did.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tom.geyzen@tandt.be">Tom Geyzen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.dienstenfabriek.be">de dienstenfabriek</a>) What we do in our company stretches beyond the development of software (and I mean this in the most positive way) but the agile manifesto still applies and is a great help to the inner working of our company

Keep up the good work guys, this is definitely the way to go !

<b>Peter van der Voorn</b>: I would like to write it in blazing letters across the sky - &quot;The customer value is in the software!&quot;. Having been personally involved in IT projects/programmes that generated volumous amounts of documentation with little software to show for it I fully endorse the values of the Agile Alliance

<b>Chris Schultz</b>.<hr>
<b>Simon Baker</b>:  (<a href="http://www.think-box.co.uk">think-box</a>) Being agile injects the fun back into software development and, in my experience, is the most effective way of delivering the right software at the right time. <hr>
<b>Giuliano Morais</b>:  (<a href="http://www.smartnet.com.br">Smarnet Brasil</a>) This is not only &quot;on more path&quot;, this is the correct path.<hr>
<b>Luis Camara Manoel</b>:  (<a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell, Inc.</a>) I support this manifesto for eliminating processes where processes were not needed, taking communication where doors had typically been closed, taking innovative ideas where they can flourish, taking change where it can improve upon our work.<hr>
<b>Sergey Shafran</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:pascofield@hotmail.com">Paul Scofield</a>: For years I have been using the term &quot;Agile&quot; when describing my systems requirements.  It&#39;s only now that I find others support this idea!

Agility is THE pre-requisite of not just software development, but of all effective business systems.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bcraun@financialware.com">William Craun</a>:  (<a href="http://www.financialware.com">Financialware, Inc.</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:brian.kiser@ky.gov">Brian Kiser</a>:  (Kentucky State Government) I&#39;d like to see Agile implementated where I work.  It seems that everyone here, even those who profess to dislike heavyweight methodologies, seem to push more and more for &quot;process&quot; and documentation over the core things that really matter, like producing good software.  It&#39;s very discouraging to someone who&#39;s been out in the field producing good software for many years.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rvacas@sinergiaconsulting.es">Rafael Vacas</a>:  (Sinergia Consulting, A Coruña, Spain) Thank you Agile Manifesto. Thank you for putting down in words the truth about software development.<hr>

<b>Eric Kramer</b>:  (<a href="http://www.wendys.com">Wendy's International</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:aaronlewis@guildportal.com">Aaron Lewis</a>:  (<a href="http://www.guildportal.com">Axiom Shift, LLC</a>) With our community hosting software, which has morphed over time based upon customer requirements, the people we answer to and communicate with during development are our clients.  We&#39;ve been following the Agile method for years, consulting with our clients from the moment development starts to the day code is pushed.

The result of following the Agile principles in every aspect of our business has resulted in satisfied customers and better software.<hr>
<b>Barry Forrest</b>: It&#39;s about time that a better way of doing things was established. I&#39;m not anti-documentation, but it should develop alongside the key deliverables, with input from both the technical and user communities. More customer collaboration over requirements and contracts is essential, we provide solutions to address customer needs, the customer needs to participate all through the development and delivery process. However, resistance from legal, contractual and purchasing departments will need to be overcome before we can move forward, and that will only happen with a move away from the confrontational management styles that have developed over the past decade.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kaleem1@comcast.net">Kaleem Mohammed</a>: Agile Manifesto captures the vital issues of software development in a much better way than any other software process.Certainly uncovers better ways of developing software.<hr>

<b>Edward Daniel</b>:  (<a href="http://www.saleplane.com">SalePlane Ltd.</a>) I have never been more enthusiastic about the art of software design and engineering as now having benefitted greatly from the works of many leading thinkers represented here who share their knowledge for the benefit of others.

Well done and thank you.

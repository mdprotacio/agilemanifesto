<b>Tom Reynolds</b>:  (<a href="http://theagilemindset.wordpress.com/">http://theagilemindset.wordpress.com/</a>) Working in an agile way can be difficult for some people to grasp, but once understood and adopted there can be no going back.

The agile manifesto embodies the spirit of collaboration and communication and that human beings working together in an adaptive way will produce the best results.

Adopting an agile mindset is the beginning of a journey, one where you will never stop learning and one that will never end.<hr>

<a href="mailto:tonyc49@optusnet.com.au">Tony Christensen</a>:  (Independent) For over a decade I lead the same team of developers across 4 organizations. The team was considered one of the best in the world due to their responsiveness and ability to exceed expectations. The methods used by the team I have since recognized as those embodied in the Agile Manifesto. I whole heartedly endorse the Manifesto and the Agile movement and consider it not only &quot;best practice&quot; but question the value in the alternatives.<hr>

<b>Sanjay Kumar</b>:  (<a href="http://www.hyenalabs.com">User Experience Design </a>) I have worked in many projects based on SDLC, recentely i worked on Agile based project.I saw the huge difference and the positives in Agile framework. 

The team was electrified and the clinet was happy. One very good aspect of Agile which i think is that the clinet is able to see working delevirables which will be refined at a later point of time. <hr>

I pity the fools who unconditionally favor predictability over adaptability. I know there are still many of you out there.  Stop telling us that Agile is poor planning in disguise.  That is simply not true. In many respects, agile *is* the plan! Time to market and bleeding-edgedness are paths to competitiveness. Hence, agility is key. To blindly miss-out just for the sake of being more predictable may lead you to defeat.  As a consolation, at least you already know how much your defeat is going to cost :-)

<a href="mailto:cybervik@gmail.com">Vikram S</a>: I wish agile methodologies are adopted across the software development world.<hr>
<a href="mailto:james.riis@gmail.com">James Riis</a>:  (<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/jamiesscrumsite/">My Journey into Agile</a>) In my search for a better way to deliver software solutions, I found Agile.

I have many years of experience leading teams using various traditional software development methodologies and none really worked.  Each methodology assumed that you knew all the requirements upfront -- we ignored uncertainty.

We argued over changes and called it Scope creep.  The problem always was our customers didn&#39;t know what they wanted and the development team didn&#39;t understand the business.  At least that&#39;s what each side said -- some what adversararily. In the end no one was really happy about the outcome.

Now, using an Agile approach, I lead my development teams and business partners through and informed process.  We discuss features, the cost to build these features, and now can make informed decisions about when to implement what.  We can now trade-off features for time-to-market, and have a plan to get the features into the next  release cycle.

This is not the old, &quot;That will be in version 2&quot; which we all know will never happen.<hr>
<a href="mailto:maurizio@papini.com">Maurizio Papini</a>:  (<a href="http://magrathea.interactivity.it">interactivity.it</a>) It takes more courage to apply common sense and ones&#39; own intuitions than following somebody else articulated ways to complicate work and life.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tobenour@lakesidecoaching.com">Ted Obenour</a>:  (<a href="http://www.lakesidecoaching.com">Lakeside Business Coaching</a>) I have been working with excellerated Applications Development (XAD) since the mid 90&#39;s and lead one of the first US Government sanctioned non waterfall projects at for re-engineering the NASA Hubble Space Telescope.  It&#39;s great to see this type of thinking becoming mainstream, but since it represents a management cultural shift as well, it will continue to take more time because management still wants a cheap silver bullet.  Hang in there.  The journey is half of  battle.<hr>

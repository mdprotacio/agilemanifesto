<b>Tomislav Grospić</b>.<hr>
<b>Renato Barbieri</b>:  (IBM) We have come a long way since the early attempts to make software development an engineering practice in the 80s and 90s. I remember the comparisons betwen Construction and Software;  the latter is fundamentally different, and it requires a unique approach. The Agile Manifesto embodies a philosophy that values harmony; amongst developers themselves and their customers. Collaboration is the key to success -- no more finger-pointing. Accept that failure is needed in order to learn and better ourselves, one step at a time. Software is the ultimate malleable material; change is part of its DNA.  This Manifesto represents the soul of the Agile movement, clearly stated in its 4 values and 12 principles. A guiding light for a brighter future in the IT industry. Embrace it, live it, cherish it.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sean067@gmail.com">Sean Chandler</a>:  (caribbeannewmedia.com) For too long the development process, whether software or website, has not been a collaborative process. 

The client usually has close to zero knowledge of what&#39;s involved in the development process, and developers tend to see client&#39;s requests as the incoherent ramblings of the uninitiated.

I believe the manifesto addresses these imbalances, and it &#39;s up to the developers to implement it and the clients to embrace it.<hr>

People create software, so it makes sense that we would focus on human interplay to reduce waste and increase value. In an ironic coincidence, people also create the processes and tools whose insipid expansion often burdens teams with convoluted, expensive, and ultimately unnecessary hurdles. Keep procedures, standards, and systems lightweight and be mindful of their voracious appetite for pernicious expansion.

Documentation is an abstraction which describes, but does not inherently deliver business value. The value in what we create stems only from its actual creation. Scientist and philosopher Alfred Korzybski observed that &quot;the map is not the territory.&quot; The abstraction is not the thing itself.

Disunion between customer and developer decelerates delivery of business value by introducing avoidable waste and cost. Ironically, the false protection which a contract-mentality promises serves only to exacerbate the underlying distrust and animus from which this division originates. It is only through genuine partnership and mutual respect and understanding that we can optimize outcomes. This fragile condition takes time to form and must be continuously nurtured.

The notion of formulating and following a detailed proposal for achieving a goal is intrinsically valid. Where some teams stumble, however, is in considering the initial manifestation of that plan to be an immutable object. Unwillingness or failure to adjust based on performance and changing conditions dooms many projects to history&#39;s graveyard. Part of the plan (perhaps the most important part) needs to be changing the plan. 

Over the last 20 years, I have managed (or been a team member on) several multimillion dollar projects for some of the most recognizable brands and well-respected companies in the world. From that vantage point, I have observed and experienced the immediate and lasting benefits of transitioning from Waterfall to Agile (Scrum in particular). I cannot recommend strongly enough that serious consideration be paid to making this fundamental shift in your organization. 

Scrum&#39;s iterative, incremental, and collaborative approach to software development accelerates delivery of business value; builds-in quality; and improves productivity. The Agile Manifesto succinctly captures the essence of the practice and serves as the foundation upon which great project success may be built.<hr>

<a href="mailto:gevans@usf.edu">Gail B. Evans</a>:  (University of South Florida) I whole-heartedly endorse the Agile Manifesto. I am a recent newbie to the Agile World, having just recently completed a Scrum Master training course.  The Agile Manifesto speaks to me at my core and the role I emulate as a servant leader within my organization.  To value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, how AWESOME is that!  To have a customer feel this as you work with them on a project that they are what is most important to you!  You are co-partners with them.  You both share in the joy and pains of the project together working as a cohesive, collaborative team.  To value a working product over comprehensive documentation!  What a novel idea! LOL!!! To value customer collaboration over contract negotiation, to care more about your working product that meets your customers’ needs rather than ensuring your contract eliminates or deters scope creep. Wow!!!  Lastly, to value responding to change over following a plan, to be able to say to a customer that it’s ok if you changed your mind. To be open-minded, flexible and understanding of change that it can and mostly likely will occur on a project and it is fine.  To know, the world as you know it will not stop revolving for you or your customer because of a change.  You both can and will overcome it and learn from the experience.   To appreciate the items to the right of the Agile Manifesto but to value those on the left more!  I LOVE it!!!<hr>

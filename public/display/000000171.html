<a href="mailto:enrique.j.matta@gmail.com">Enrique Matta</a>: I have worked in many shops as a Quality Assurance Engineer, and by far the best way to develop is following a true agile model. In my new company I am a strong advocate of these points, since the end result is more stable software that meet the ever changing requirements of this industry.<hr>

<a href="mailto:ShanKonduru@gmail.com">Shan Konduru (Ravi Bhushan Konduru)</a>:  (<a href="http://www.AppLabs.com">AppLabs Inc, USA</a>) I continue to bring Agile principals into the organizations &amp; customers I work with. I am sure these Agile principals would help all the Agile Practitioners, to reduce the Product Cycle Time, reduce Time To Market, improve your Teams Productivity, achieve Product Excellence and eventually surpass all the competitors of the Business you are in. All the best.

<b>Nader Ibrahim</b>: This principles mentioned are the ones I&#39;ve come to on my own in 12 years of software development.  Face to face interactions directly with motivated business people with an honest attempt to meet their needs is far superior to &quot;CYA&quot; methodologies which seek to mitigate liability.<hr>

While the conservative processes have their merits, agile methodologies far outweigh them.<hr>
<a href="mailto:aleksander.brancewicz@gmail.com">Aleksander Brancewicz</a>: I&#39;ve been successfully leading J2EE development initiatives for several years so far. Impact is moved from in detail defined process to people collaboration thus building teams, people enrollment and creating learning organization are crucial. Additionally best agile teams are those organized around features (full flow coverage) instead of technical components. Companies with well organized processes around components and formal technical leadership may not benefit from change to Agile. As a result their current structure may work best for them and should not be distorted.     <hr>

<b>Luis Ferreira</b>: I found out that I’ve being pursuing these 12 these principals all my professional life without being able to pronounce them with the adequate clarity expose in this manifesto.<hr>

<b>Marc Story</b>:  (<a href="http://www.pinnacol.com/">Pinnacol Assurance</a>) Serving as a Product Manager as well as a Project Mangager following Agile principles helps deliver the most value in the shortest timeframe and eliminate uneeded, low-value work.

It also makes software development about benefits from fucntionality instead of documentation.<hr>

It has allowed us to become an even stronger team, who can respond to market changes more quickly. Agile has transformed our organization.  Also, our adoption of SCRUM and Kanban, has had such a positive impact.  To all of those who blazed the trail before (and for) us - Thank You!<hr>

<b>Manuel Tena</b>:  (<a href="http://comprartabletbaratas.com.es">Tablets Baratas</a>) I think this manifesto is really something many people should support. I consider all points really interesting and specially those concerning the help to others to develop software and the customer collaboration. 

Thanks for the efforts.<hr>

<b>John Kenny</b>:  (McAfee) We formally adopted Scrum in my team a year ago. Although we still encounter effects from our legacy of older softwear production methods, we have made huge strides forward. <hr>
<b>Neil Davis</b>: I support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<b>S. Markham Voogt</b>: I am a member of a group of rugged individualists.  We are working to develop and implement technology about which we all feel strongly, but don&#39;t always agree, sometimes for clients who don&#39;t yet know what they want.  The Agile Manifesto has put into words the principles by which we will have to be guided in order to succeed at all.  

Thank you for writing it.  We could never have done even a fraction as well.  Also, we would probably have sworn too much to share it publicly, anyway. <hr>

<a href="mailto:srikanth.bhaskar@gmail.com">Srikanth Bhaskar</a>: I agree to the Agile Principles, and that it brings about a change in the way we manage complex changes.

Thanks for all others that had contributed before us and made this possible.<hr>

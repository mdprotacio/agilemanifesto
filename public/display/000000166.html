<b>Chris Bence</b>:  (<a href="http://chrisbence.com">Stories From Palestine</a>) I agree with this manifesto, although my programming experience is entirely individual...  I do not have a team, nor do I want one for the small scale projects I&#39;m engaging in. I&#39;m currently developing a facebook application called Stories From Palestine to create a bridge between the Palestinian people and the outside world to show their struggle.  It has been in development for many months and is in its finally stages.<hr>

Also we document our work as to make it a reference for us and for others to follow.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kmkeyzer@gmail.com">Ken Keyzer</a>: Runners become agile by running, not by obsessing over shoes and shorts. 
We become agile developers and deliver value by creating software and systems. TPS reports be damned! <hr>

<b>Vaibhav Jape</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:dave@evolgeniuslabs.com">David Fox-Triplett</a>:  (<a href="http://www.evolgeniuslabs.com">Evolgenius Creative/Labs</a>) Agile is a methodology that simply works.  It allows my team and our clients to quantify and prioritize what it is that is of most value to them.  This allows us deliver our solutions quicker over multiple iterations and also creates an atmosphere of involvement.  This &quot;hands-on&quot; interaction with clients fosters a new-found awareness of what was once oblivious to them, namely what goes on &quot;behind the scenes&quot;... the things they do not see that every development project entails.  Because of this we are allowed to unveil projects sooner, implement the most important things first, quickly tackle obstacles and create accountability.  Projects have in a sense become living and breathing things, which evolve through collaboration and adapt to change easily... The best part...? We never receive the dreaded slew of phone-calls from a failed delivery because everyone is kept in the loop.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kanmani.rajendran@gmail.com">Kanmani Rajendra</a>:  (Mascon global limited) I agree to the Agile process. I feel only with continuour interaction, showing the partial working results a requirement can be gathered efficiently.<hr>
<a href="mailto:agustin.villena@chileagil.cl">Agustin Villena</a>:  (<a href="http://www.chileagil.cl">ChileAgil</a>) I&#39;m the founder of a local movement of knowledge workers that truly believes on the value of people, teamwork, and deliver frequently high quality value through functional software. And our beliefs are inspiren on the worldwide Agile and Lean culture.<hr>
<b>Jim Sheffield</b>:  (<a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/vms/staff/jim-sheffield.aspx">Victoria University of Wellington</a>) After some decades as a IT Project Manager, I have experienced the power of Agile Methods in facilitating complex inter-organisational situations involving considerable confusion and conflict. 

My URL mentions major action research initiatives that include the development of economic strategy, science policy, and comprehensive regional planning. Some of the 100  papers listed there talk about critical issues in knowledge management, i.e., that embodied and embrained knowledge that is enacted to fulfil aspirations which, upon further reflection, will always remain somewhat conflicted and confused.

I have no doubt that the Agile Manifesto and 12 Principles capture the spirit, and reflect the attitudes, skills and behaviour that is  required to manage the real and irreducible complexity in project management. 

I therefore strongly support the Agile Manifesto.

<b>Sateesh Narahari</b>: Agile development is the most sensible way to develop software - I can not imagine doing it the old fashioned Waterfall model anymore. <hr>
<b>Lloyd Smith</b>:  (<a href="http://lingoswap.com">Lingoswap</a>) Agile is awesome!<td width="233"><a href="mailto:charles.teague @intel.com">Charles Teague (Chip)</a>:  (<a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel, Corp.</a>) In my own trek thru this software development world, learning the waterfall methodology in college and attempting to apply in the business world, I believe it is still a very important route for students to take. I say this because I believe that it was important for me to see first hand how that &quot;engineering&quot; discipline is not the best team-based &quot;thought process&quot; for developing an evolving, maintainable software system, and fostering trust among the team members and with the customers. Among the many, I believe the biggest eye-opener for me with eXtreme/Agile mentality has been, Waterfall promotes CYA, Agile promotes trust &amp; team work.<hr>

<a href="mailto:chris.horn@calgary.ca">Chris Horn</a>:  (The City of Calgary) As a programmer analyst who has practiced agile for two years now, I have to say that agile has given me a greater ability to succeed and grow professionally than traditional methods of software development. Empowerment is sometimes overlooked but IMO the biggest key to agile.</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000165.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

<b>Daniel Morrison</b>:  (<a href="http://collectiveidea.com">[i] Collective Idea</a>) The Manifesto is radical because it works. It takes diving in and trying it to understand that there are better ways to develop software.<hr>

<b>Christoph SIKULA</b>:  (<a href="http://www.transportation.siemens.com">Siemens Transportation Systems</a>) The approach evolves at the right timing -- since getting rid of complicated development-processes and their vague value are discussed in these harsh economic times.
Apart from this, i favour the matching of customer needs AND employees/creators day-2-day needs!
The Vision is - more fun at developing better systems with less effort.
Thank you!<hr>

<b>Riaan Snyders</b>:  (Private) In the world of software development it seems as if quality has taken a back seat to generating money. I think agile will put things back into perspective and put the focus back on quality and not quantity.<hr>

<a href="mailto:wally@nealpmp.com">Walter Neal</a>:  (Neal Project Management) <td width="233"><b>Morten Jagd Christensen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.jcaps.com">jCAPS</a>) Experiencing that process driven software quality assurance is now done by grey haired men who &#39;used to be a programmer&#39; (15 years ago) i find the Agile Manifesto refreshening and very much in line with my own thinking. I would like to advocate for automatic unit testing, preferably coverage based, as this is one very usefull and Agile way to guarantee the &#39;working code&#39; codex.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kklundt@environmax.com">Keith Klundt</a>:  (EnvironMax, Inc.) I&#39;ve seen agile principles in practice result in greater quantity and higher quality of working software, and in an increased level of trust and confidence between the customer and the development team.<hr>
<b>Rufino Rabin</b>: I&#39;ve worked on med-large scale project for almost 6 years and had encountered a lot of software development practices both its flaws and advantages. Id like to get involved to learn and both share my experience on this manifesto.

<a href="mailto:icordovam@aeromexico.com.mx">Isra Maya</a>: Working with humans and for humans is something that has been fogotten by  some software developers, however you have promoted an important interaction among them.<hr>
<a href="mailto:craig.e.jones@wellsfargo.com">Craig Jones</a>:  (Wells Fargo) I&#39;ve always been a proponent of the Agile Manifesto principles even before they were listed here - simply because they make sense and strike the balance between the various project development considerations.  I also think the AM works because it is centered on spiritual principles, which is something unfortunately you can&#39;t teach.  An engineer who is just out to make a buck, or is too absorbed in creating their own archaic world of wizardry (rather than doing what&#39;s best for their customers and peers) won&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the manifesto or even bother to search for it.  At the least it brings together those of us who lead with our hearts AND our heads.<hr>

<b>Jaap Schreurs</b>:  (DVNdesign) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:billingsley@cox.net">Arthur Billingsley</a>: Over the past 28 years of involvement in the computing and information technology business,  much of my personal and professional success can be attributed to the adherence to the  principles of the agile manifesto. While I was not aware of this articulation until this year, I support and validate these principles as integral perspectives to innovative and collaborative work. My professional work, has to date, been primarily in national defense information technology and adjunct teaching in academia. While I was aware of extreme programming initiatives, I had no awareness of the agile manifesto. In 1994, using DoD acquisition reform initiatives, I formed and led an Integrated Product Team, to collaborate as a team with the prime contractor, in reviewing and understanding the Mil-STD, Mil-SPEC project performance specifications. Since the initial performance  requirements had changed since project initiation, the integrated project team (IPT) proposed and implemented changes to the performance specification. The project was then baselined and the integrated project team worked to deliver a commercially baselined unit within 18 months of rebaselining. The commercially baselined unit demonstrated superior operational performance against many requirements and met all requirements. We leveraged an open systems architecture (OSA) with commercially available components and reused software (ADA and C) from the previous development efforts.  The principle, used at that time,  to enable sweeping project changes to all elements of the project was “build a little, test a little.” The collaborative  development of the rebaselined performance specification allowed the prime contractorto deliver units that met or exceeded project requirements while reducing overall acquisition costs. The principles of the agile manifesto are repeatable, manageable, understandable and effective. From my experience, these principle should be considered “best practices” for innovative and collaborative environments.<hr>
<a href="mailto:taco@tijsma.nl">Taco Tijsma</a>:  (Centric) I welcome the idea that our industry is less and less compared to the building industry and that our industry is done by professionals only. Respecting them and their skils is crucial.<hr>

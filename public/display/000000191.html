Apoyamos este pensamiento que realmente permite ser competitivos ante un mercado que se lo lleva todo a su paso.

Our work always focused on those premises but we had no idea there was this agile manifesto. We support this thinking can be really competitive to a market that takes everything in its path.<hr>

<b>Anand Kandimalla</b>: I have worked on SDLCs which followed waterfall, RUP and Agile methodologies. I had great success with Agile software development. The amazing part in following Agile methodology was the users felt involved in the project as they were able to interact with working software every two weeks and at the end of the day we were able to implement a complete working software which met all the user requirements.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ostromdj@ieee.org">Donald Ostrom</a>: Since 1967 I have seen every imaginable development methodology used. The Agile manifesto sums up nicely the values that I learned over my career!.<hr>

<b>Taillard Pierre</b>: Agile Methodology is so natural and efficient that it is an evidence for me to apply it. No more demo is needed, time is come to deploy it.<hr>
<b>Roberto Antonio Becerra García</b>:  (Universidad de Holguín) I think that&#39;s Agile is the better way to build software nowdays.<hr>

<a href="mailto:vroshchyn@gmail.com">Vladyslav Roshchyn</a>:  (<a href="http://angristtech.com">Angrist Technologies</a>) Being in software development business for more than 16 years, I feel that Agile methodology and set of principles not only brings a huge potential and value to customers and teams, but the only way to do projects effectively nowadays. And of course Agile brings tons of ways to excell so it&#39;s the most dynamic modern methodology. <hr>

<b>Nick Leonard</b>:  (<a href="http://www.virnik.co.uk">Virnik Evolution Limited</a>) The Agile Manifesto is a clear set of values which could be used for so much more than computer software.  Politics, Banking, Research and Commercial art, could all benefit from this way of thinking.<hr>

<b>Laurent Tardif</b>:  (<a href="http://ouelcum.wordpress.com/">Cara / Agilent / Yahoo</a>) <hr>
<b>Barry Tipping</b>: Agile works!<hr>
<b>John Sarazen</b>: I worked on some precursors to agile software and infrastructure project management in the early 1990&#39;s at Bell Labs.  While we realized many incremental benefits from our crude approaches and hoped for something better someday, none of us expected this remarkable outcome.  My experience with Agile project management in both software and infrastructure domains has again and again demonstrated the business value of the Agile manifesto.  Obviously, I&#39;m an avid supporter.<hr>
<b>Philip Chew</b>: Traditional methods of software development fail to take into account the developer and customer&#39;s welfare and points of view. Agile may prove to be the better way in paving the way for customers to understand the way developers work, and developers to empathize with the difficulties customers have.<hr>

<a href="mailto:roberto.quarantiello@altran.it">Roberto Quarantiello</a>:  (Altran Italia) In 14 years of professional work I&#39;ve always tried to apply the Agile Manifesto items. <td width="233"><b>Peter Knauber</b>:  (Mannheim University of Applied Sciences) To me it&#39;s essential that we do not only teach traditional development approaches but also help our students to get into the right mindset.
Part of this is the awareness that &quot;agile != skip documentation&quot;.<hr>
<b>Florian Schaller</b>:  (<a href="http://www.schaller-werbeagentur.de">Schaller Werbeagentur GmbH</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:anishkartha@gmail.com">Anish Kartha</a>:  (KPMG) Agile gets the team involved in an unbelievable manner. Everyone has a sense of ownership and the barriers of information are broken down.<hr>

<a href="mailto:stelatta@gmail.com">Samar Elatta</a>:  (<a href="http://www.agiletransformation.com">Agile Transformation</a>) The value agile can bring into organizations and the way software is build is undeniable. Agile has created a new working relationship between those who build software and those who use it. It has connected them, and like magic these companies out perform and out shine their counterparts.. and the software they build is much more valuable to its users because they had a say in what they wanted, but flexibility to be able to change their mind to fit the ever changing business needs.
I endorse the agile values. <hr>

I look forward to continuing to grow as a professional while trying to harness the agile framework. Thanks to all the founders for your great work!<hr>

<b>Ethan D. Keiley</b>:  (<a href="http://www.fantasymultimedia.com">Fantasy Multimedia</a>) I agree with and support agile development and the agile manifesto.  I have been working with agile for about 2 years now and I will never return to my old ways.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ahmed@obscure.pk">Ahmed Shuja</a>:  (<a href="http://obscure.pk">Obscure Interactive</a>) I am basically a software engineer, now a user centered design practitioner after graduating with a MS degree in Human Computer Interaction. I opted to study HCI because I believed in the Agile Manifesto before I read it. I believed in it because I saw too many failed software projects, which valued the items on the right more than the items on the left! <hr>

<a href="mailto:alex@chermenin.ru">Alex Chermenin</a>:  (<a href="http://www.prognoz.com">JSC Prognoz</a>) Yep, Agile Manifesto is wonderful and I support it!<hr>
<b>Ralph J. Mauelshagen</b>: No way is perfect.  However, Agile is simpler, a more natural fit for human behaviors.  And when changes and late discovery throw a wrench into the works of other ways, Agile lets us use the wrench instead of dread it.  I’m in!<hr>

<b>William Hubert</b>: As a relatively new programmer just entering the field, I wholeheartedly support the Agile methodology as a design practice for it&#39;s ability to adapt and adjust to the rapid changes in technology as well as the underlying principle to give the client not only what they ask for but, more importantly, what they NEED, from their software.<hr>
<b>Mauricio André de Almeida</b>: I support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<a href="mailto:ajaygupta2@yahoo.com">Ajay Gupta</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:fashraf@altuwairqi.com">Firoz Ashraf</a>:  (<a href="http://www.altuwairqi.com">Tuwairqi Holding</a>) I agree with the Agile Manifesto.<hr>
<b>Midhun Girish</b>:  (<a href="http://origamitechnologies.com">Origami Technologies</a>) From my experience in the past 5 years I fully understand that the core idea of Agile Manifesto is 100% accurate.I support the agile manifesto and will be working to spread the idea.<hr>
<b>Régis Jacquelin</b>:  (CROUS de Clermont-Ferrand) <hr>
<b>Brian Vanderjack</b>:  (<a href="http://AgileLand.co">PMHighway</a>) I support and endorse the content of the Agile Manifesto as a valid, and valuable, method to develop working, customer-centric, software-based-systems.<hr>
<a href="mailto:alan.m.hornstein@gmail.com">Alan M Hornstein</a>: PMI-ACP, PMP<hr>
<b>Joe Bright</b>:  (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joe-bright/a/861/399/">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joe-bright/a/861/399/</a>) Think upon these things and you are sure to see the value they provide to developing software.  100% of the time something will be lost in communication.  This is because we are human - plain and simple.  But how will you know what was lost?  You wont know until you deliver what you think your client asked for.  So why not deliver day by day and adapt to their response... it just makes sense!<hr>
<b>Christopher Sekaran</b>: Agile in its true form is designed to uplift the team and thus delivering the best product by the team for the customer. <hr>
<b>Simone Arcangeli</b>:  (<a href="http://www.bizeware.com">Bizeware</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:alexis.henriquezb@gmail.com">Alexis Henríquez</a>: The agile principles allows us to add more business value. In practice this has been proven. Because of that, I stand for agile manifesto and promote it between my colleagues.<hr>
<a href="mailto:stefan.goergner@gmail.com">Stefan Goergner</a>.<hr>
<b>Jonas Pettersson</b>: The ideas are so simple that they seem to be too good to be true. They works, effectively so, but even knowing so, they still seems too good to be true.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:peter.d.faria@gmail.com">Peter D Faria</a>: I have been following the Agile Development practices on my current team for several months now. With a constant focus on keeping high quality in our code and finished product, we have been developing at break-neck speeds. The team is highly motivated, everyone gets a say in the direction of the project, and our business users are more than happy with the outcome. It&#39;s truly a win-win situation.<hr>
<b>Devin Crawford</b>: The principals and ideas put forth in the manfiesto encompass a sensible, common sense approach to software development with clearly stated goals for success. It is essential to keep these relatively simple prinicipals in focus when developing complex software tools.  In particular, management must live these pricipals and convey the spirit of agile development to the team.  If this doesn&#39;t happen &quot;agile&quot; becomes nothing more than 5 letters.<hr>
<a href="mailto:josh@dipperstove.com">Josh Sullivan</a>:  (<a href="http://dipperstove.com">http://dipperstove.com</a>) The Agile Manifesto embodies everything that makes software development a joy to take part in.<hr>
<a href="mailto:domitien.dijon@gmail.com">Domitien Dijon</a>: This is like a Jamie Oliver&#39;s recipe ! Simple ingredients that make the best dishes !<hr>
<a href="mailto:pinar.ayorak@nice-teknoloji.com">Pınar Ayorak</a>:  (<a href="http://www.nice-teknoloji.com">Nice Teknoloji</a>) I am signing Agile Software Development Manifesto because years of experience have been proved to me that Agile Methodology is increasing the quality of people&#39;s lives by highering the working conditions and the quality of outcomes.<hr>
<b>Jürgen Habermeier</b>.<hr>
<b>Bipin T.S</b>: Agile principles are aligned to today&#39;s needs in software development. We see more change requests coming in due to increased stakeholder involvement. Also, gated ( go / no go ) decisions are becoming more important to save cost if a project is not going well. Agile principles and manifesto have become increasingly relevant<hr>
<b>Barbara DeVries</b>:  (<a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com">Bank of America</a>) We are adopting the IIBA competency of Agile Business Analyst also.<hr>
<b>Nagesh Sharma</b>: I have been practicing Agile since past 5 years, I fully understand &amp; support the core idea of Agile Manifesto and agree that it is 100% accurate.I support the agile manifesto and will be working to spread the idea wherever i could.<hr>
<a href="mailto:galatoni@gmail.com">Derek Ling</a>: I believe in the Agile Manifesto.<hr>
<b>Matt Olenik</b>.<hr>
<b>jon silver</b>:  (<a href="http://momentumdesignlab.com">momentum design lab</a>) While the manifesto is simple in structure and sparse on words, there is much wisdom here.  Understanding of these concepts is important for the successful application of any agile methodology on real-world projects.<hr>
<b>Brian Okken</b>:  (<a href="http://pythontesting.net">PythonTesting.net</a>) Just as relevant today is it was in 2002. <hr>
<b>Chris Kerr</b>.<hr>
<b>Rohit Ratan Mani</b>.<hr>
<b>Zachary Cannon</b>:  (Improving Enterprises) <td width="233"><b>Stefan Carpentier</b>:  (Design Like You Give a Damn) I am in and all over these principles for many years now, would not know how else to manage a complex and innovative software project efficiently and to greatest customer satisfaction. It allows humans to be human and keep improving, tweaking, coming up with better solutions; right up to the last minute before release. Only if you have your customer &quot;in your boat&quot; can you be sure of acceptance at release time.<hr>
<a href="mailto:christopher@mann.fr">Christopher Mann</a>: The Agile manifesto, for me, is an assertion of any software team&#39;s needs in the context of a business environment. It recognizes the legitimate values of the innovator team-member, namely working software, human individuals, seeking to work with the customer, being grounded in a changing environment. It also shows respect for differing values outside of the team : process, documentation, contracts, longer-term  plans.

The Agile principles would also receive my endorsement. They nuance and contextualize the Agile Manifesto. There is strong wording here, such as &quot;must.&quot; It is not neutral. It is not short, even though not seeming long. The principles do not contradict one another, but it is easy to contradict one by following another. They are a package deal. What a beautiful challenge!

Sincerely,

Christopher<hr>

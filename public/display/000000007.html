As CTO of vivid studios, Modem Media and Modulant, ASD has been the cornerstone of development success.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jadeflon@netappsmexico.com">Jorge DeFlon</a>:  (<a href="http://www.netappsmexico.com">NetApplications</a>) We love developing and at least a development method recognises people as the main and most important piece.<hr>
<a href="mailto:morganrg@optushome.com.au">Robert Morgan</a>: 
I get blank stares when I caution about processes which mandate a strict requirements-driven delivery.  Building for as-yet unimagined requirements, and relaxing some of the constraints in the conception-specification-build process, allows for faster realisation of solutions, assuming that your team is capable of understanding and delivering the flexibility of implementation to accomodate it.<hr>
<a href="mailto:hsmits@vision.com">Hubert Smits</a>:  (<a href="http://www.vision.com">Vision Consultants ltd.</a>) Very much interested in implementing agile principles in large scale projects and processes.<hr>
<b>Nick Jones</b>: Software is about delivering useful services to people. Words like &quot;useful&quot;, &quot;services&quot; and &quot;people&quot; being the important ones.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jdanforth@facilitator4hire.com">Janet E. Danforth, CPF</a>:  (<a href="http://www.facilitator4hire.com">Facilitator4hire, Inc.</a>) Whether we are talking about DSDM, Extreme Programming or Crystal Methods, the common link is collaboration, the hard &quot;soft stuff.&quot;  Excellent collaboration does not happen by accident or by wishing it so.  The real value in collaboration comes by design, and is usually focused by someone with facilitation skills.  Some Agile approaches formally recognize the need for preparing the environment with enhanced core competencies in facilitation and collaboration.  Their results speak for themselves.  The teams we are working with in Europe and the US consistently reinforce that &quot;individuals and interactions&quot; make or break projects.<hr>

<a href="mailto:centro@altera.it">Matteo Centro</a>:  (<a href="http://www.altera.it">altEra e-business solutions</a>) Small companies facing big OOP projects can&#39;t afford &quot;traditional&quot; approaches. We find Agile Software Development very similar to what we tried to develop in the last year and we expect to integrate our methodology with Agile Software Development in the next months to be more efficient and produce even better results.
Thank you.<hr>

<b>Joe Combs</b>:  (<a href="http://www.convergys.com">Convergys</a>) After working in a processs laden environment, agility reminds me why I entered the field in the first place<td width="233"><a href="mailto:faisal_219@hotmail.com">Faisal Mahmood</a>:  (Eneris Solutions) I am sure that the agile manisfesto has all the necessary ingredients, customer orientation, reduced software process complexity and effectice interaction, required for a successful and lighweight methodology. Yet it doesn&#39;t resist any changes which is a feature not often found in common methodologies.<hr>
<a href="mailto:boscht@boscht.com">Bård Magnus Dale</a>: I love this stuff!<hr>

<a href="mailto:andyliu@ecquaria.com">Andy Lau</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:stian@lavik.com">Stian Lavik</a>: I totally agree on the principles behind the Manifesto, and I think the agile way represents a change of paradigms, due to its values and perspecitves.<hr>
<a href="mailto:eirik@hesthamar.net">Eirik André Hesthamar</a>: Agile Methodologies is a step in the right direction.<hr>

<b>Dafydd Rees</b>:  (<a href="http://www.dafydd.net">www.dafydd.net</a>) I&#39;m particularly keen on test-driven development, and the importance of learning by doing.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ccantonn@adinet.com.uy">Carlos Cantonnet</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sbindiganavile@isinet.com">Sudi Bindiganavile</a>:  (Thomson Scientific) I certainly agree and support the Agile Manifesto, in particular Responding to change over following a plan. Instead of changing the plan, plan for the change and we will be better off. The second important manifesto that I support and have used is individuals and interactions over processes and tools. One thing I have noticed with my team by using these manifesto, they are charged up and motivated amidst all the bumpy rides.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kirill_kalishev@mail.ru">Kirill Kalishev</a>:  (<a href="http://www.kirillkalishev.com">http://www.kirillkalishev.com</a>) I am a programmer who does XP, writes things on XP in Russian and holds (hopefully) interesting seminars on agile development.<hr>

<b>Simon Chatfield</b>:  (<a href="http://www.thechatfieldgroup.com/">The Chatfield Group, Inc.</a>) In working on hundreds of projects for many different clients, I have found that the architect&#39;s ability to be adaptive to change during the development process is key to success. As developers we need to embrace the ever changing requirements of our clients and build solutions that allow for those changes.<hr>
<a href="mailto:george@netpath.net">George Pauly</a>:  (Ring Associates, LLC) Interaction is a process.
Software is documentation.
Collaboration is a covenantal relationship.
This too shall pass.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wrau@concur.com">Will Rau</a>:  (Concur Technologies) I especially like Alistair Cockburn&#39;s focus on the human factors that make Agile Development work.<hr>
<a href="mailto:vukosi@icon.co.za">A. Banyini</a>: I FOUND THE AGILE CONCEPT GREAT. IT WAS APPLIED BY A CONTRACTOR IN A PUBLIC ORGANISATION WHERE MOST PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE IT NOR PROJECT CONCEPT. AS A MANAGER OF THIS PUBLIC ORGANISATION, I NOW BELIEVE  THE CONTRACTOR FOLLOWED THE MANIFESTO TO BOOK<hr>
<a href="mailto:hechanova@mindspring.com">Beth Hechanova</a>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:alex.iskold@informationlaboratory.com">Alex Iskold</a>:  (<a href="http://www.thesmallworlds.com">Information Laboratory, Inc</a>) I am attracted to agile methods because they embody insights of complex natural systems. Systems are not engineered, they evolve. Programming is the dialog between engineer and the software. It is an art form, where through the process of continious refinement a beautiful and correct software emerges.<hr>

<b>Thomas Wrensch</b>:  (<a href="http://www1.uop.edu/~twrensch/">University of the Pacific</a>) I have used some of these techniques in
Smalltalk projects, and found them to be very
effective. Now, as a teacher, I need to find
a way to expose my students to Agile programming.
I believe this alliance will be a boon to
enlighted teachers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:dave@redsquirreldesign.com">Dave Hoover</a>:  (<a href="http://www.redsquirreldesign.com/dave/">Red Squirrel Design</a>) I am just beginning my journey with Agile Software Development but I have already been profoundly impacted by what I have learned.  I am currently adopting XP practices into my development work and beginning to research how certain post-modern theories of family therapy might be integrated into agile methodologies.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jbr@diasparsoftware.com">J. B. Rainsberger</a>:  (<a href="http://www.diasparsoftware.com">Diaspar Software Services</a>) I support the Agile Alliance and its manifesto primarily because people are so highly-valued. In my opinion, it is critical never to lose sight of the human elements in software development. The manifesto clearly expresses that all participants in a software project are valued above all else. I commit to advancing this cause in my own work, along side (at least in spirit) the pioneers of the Agile Alliance.<hr>
<a href="mailto:bala@cs.wustl.edu">Balachandran Natarajan</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~bala">Washington University</a>) All the things that I think I missed when I used to work as a consultant. As a Research Associate, I get to do most of the Agile development&#39;s manifesto and there seems to be better results. <hr>
<a href="mailto:sumeet.parmar@developersatlarge.com">Sumeet Parmar</a>:  (<a href="http://www.developersatlarge.com">Developers At Large Inc</a>) The gravest mistake is to take a certain paradigm or philosophy and try to force it onto something that needs better understanding. That&#39;s what is wrong with the present software development situation. The majority simply took the pages out of traditional engineering practices as a guidebook to software development while completely neglecting to acknowledge the true nature of software.

Agile Manifesto will hopefully mend some of those mistakes and pave the way for a more profitable industry.<hr>

<a href="mailto:tonyazar@big.com.lb">Tony Azar</a>:  (<a href="http://www.big.com.lb">BIG </a>) We have actually applied agile software development in some of the projects where cost was not an issue.  However we have always went with the design/engineering approach where cost was tight.

I believe that clients should understand this concept and help developers not worry about time frames and man/day costs and all the contractual crap that comes along.<hr>

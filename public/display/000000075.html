<a href="mailto:muralim@eprama.com">M V Muralidharan</a>:  (<a href="http://www.eprama.com">ePrama Technologies</a>) I believe that the software development methodolgies continue to evolve due to the reuse of the knowledge gained during various projects and is a natural phenomenon of continuous process improvement. This truely represents the highest level of process maturity in CMMI terminology i.e, Optimizing. 

Looking for the day when the umpteen number of methodologies that are floating around will condense into small and manageable number of methodologies. This will benefit the Software Project Managers across the universe.

I will be keen to participate actively in this initiative.<hr>
<b>Luca Maistrello</b>:  (<a href="http://www.MaiSofTXp.com">MaiSofT XP</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:borinski@optonline.net">Arie Borinski</a>: Agile Methodologies is the only way to go in modern computing.  The traditional SDLC has never worked unless it’s been supported by responsible individuals inconspicuously using agile approach instead.<hr>
<b>Eddie Merkel</b>: The more I learn about Agile, the more I realize that I have been agile even when I didn&#39;t know what agile was!  I longed for structure and process when I worked in environments that didn&#39;t have any but when I learned what Agile programming actually meant, I knew I was where I belonged.<hr>
<b>Fiona Darroch</b>: Still the best thing to have happened to software development!<hr>
<a href="mailto:chris.cheng@madtech.com.my">Chris Cheng</a>:  (<a href="http://www.madtech.com.my">MAD Technologies</a>) I support quicker software development as opposed to a long and drawn out process.

I support usable software as opposed to cumbersome everything except the kitchen sink unless the customer needs it. 

I support K.I.S.S (Keep it Simple for Success! I know what its suppose to mean but no point being negative) 

I support and embrace change. 

I support the Agile Manifesto<hr>
<a href="mailto:vaclav.provaznik@hp.com">Vaclav Provaznik</a>:  (<a href="http://www.hp.com">Hewlett Packard</a>) In computer science from 1971 (yes 1971) in IT/IS delivery.
Credo today:
1. the life = agile
2. the driver = business/customer
3. the infrastructure = enough power, reliability and flexibility 
4. the chance = optimal price/performance with style, elegance, culture, trust in co-operation and trust the people
5. the entire life = Knuth&#39;s &quot;art&quot;
6. Appreciate in working within Agile Manifesto community.

<a href="mailto:eps@captorgroup.com">Erik Sacre</a>:  (<a href="http://www.captorgroup.com/">Captor</a>) We believe in the values of the Agile Manifesto. I would like to add that software development can only become successful if all parties involved dare to be honest, even if the message is painful. Sometimes it is necessary to take some short-term pain to get some long-term gain.

We enjoy the rhythm of red-green-refactor, and the beat of short iterations.<hr>

<b>Jennifer Hunt</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:wolf@schumacherpartners.net">Wolf Schumacher</a>:  (<a href="http://www.schumacherpartners.net">Schumacher Partners, Sydney Australia</a>) Based on our own experience, I am more than ever convinced that the Agile Manifesto should be in the minds and hearts of anybody who is somehow linked to developing business software. <hr>
<a href="mailto:mark.zecca@mitchell1.com">Mark Zecca</a>:  (<a href="http://Mitchell1.com">Mitchell 1</a>) Understand, Build, Test, Run (UBTR-You Better!) An interative rhythm of software and product creation. The rhythm is fed by people interacting with people, not specs, building for change and not for posterity, building as a response to customer/user questions that have been funneled to their most basic level, honest communication between engineers, customers, and product managers, and constant tweaking for efficency.<hr>
<b>Steven Schiroli</b>: I have just graduated from the University of Kent, in my second year I took a course on XP Programming that was given by Ian Marshal. I remember thinking that this was a great way to develop software and when I did get a job as a developer I would like them to use XP. I liked the idea so much that on my third year project I wanted to use XP but unfortunately was advised against it by my project supervisor. I have just recently applied to Thoughtworks for a job and was very pleased to see that they use an agile methodology in thier development.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jason_id@hotmail.com">Anton Jason</a>:  (<a href="http://a-jason.blogspot.com">http://a-jason.blogspot.com</a>) Being in the competitive world of software development, I believe agile development methods will allows us to deliver software on time and on budget. Getting buried in the comprehensive documentations and very detail designs will significantly lengthen the project time. With frequent changes of requirement, the project time will easily get amplified; by being agile we should be able to reduce project time and shuffle around tasks and plans.<hr>

<a href="mailto:jcastillo@cbs-posi.com">Joseph Castillo</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cbs-posi.com">Custom Business Solutions Inc.</a>) Since we&#39;ve adopted Agile life has only gotten better. Thank you all for putting your heads together and getting us back to my favorite part software development (people, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.) Agile has revolutionized our development department, and our company. Case in point, our Sales department has begun to Scrum Daily, imagine that. Again thanks.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Arvind_Komarla@bmc.com">Arvind Komarla</a>:  (BMC Software) I believe in the Agile development methodology since the results are measurable in shorter timeframes. It helps build strong buy in from the team members and management.<hr>

<a href="mailto:lhcezar@hostsystems.com.br">Leonardo Cezar</a>:  (<a href="http://www.hostsystems.com.br">Host Systems - Hexa Solution's division</a>) We would like be free to develop quality software spending little time with documentation. With the Agile Manifesto we finally reach this.

Thanks to Agile&#39;s Hackers.<hr>
<b>Grzegorz Galezowski</b>:  (student at Technical University of Lodz) <td width="233"><b>Gert Van der Straeten</b>: Software development isn&#39;t only about machines and code, it&#39;s in the first place about people.<hr>
<b>Ronald Dohrn</b>:  (Delta Technology) I&#39;m a Project Manager who values the Agile Development Methodology.  It&#39;s an important tool in my toolbox.  No single methodology satisfies every need. This approach is tailored to situations where &#39;to-be&#39; process and requirements are unclear and you have a small, less than ten, extremely capable development staff.  <hr>
<b>Jesper Christensen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ticks.dk">http://www.ticks.dk</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:dspica@infovide.pl">Daniel Spica</a>: After few years of working as IT specialist I am now sure that there is only way of getting success in IT Projects - by respecting customers, by respecting your own company&#39;s business and by respecting members of the team. I find this elements in Agile Manifesto.<hr>
<b>Steve Sexton</b>: As it turns out, I&#39;ve been a proponent of agile philosophy for awhile now, I just didn&#39;t realize it.  It is such a common sense, realistic set of principles... I just didn&#39;t have a name for it.  Now I do! 

More importantly, I&#39;ve been able to help out other folks who would tell me &quot;we don&#39;t really hae a process.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t true, they just didn&#39;t use a process that conformed to traditional approaches!  Now they have a name for it too, and a sense of &#39;belonging&#39; and realizing that are other folks that share their beliefs.<hr>
<b>Carlos Neves</b>:  (<a href="http://www.lusosis.pt">LusoSis</a>) Starting programming in the 80s, in Assembly and C over Unix, I left regular programming in the 90s because of the complexity of different technologies needed to construct an application (different programming languages, Databases, Web, GUI, OSs, etc.. – I have written some simple OSs and Databases) and because my work move more to network, VoIP and security projects. Today (2006) I am back with a Data Mining project, and because I believe in the Agile Manifesto and the pragmatic approach needed to improve software production and maintenance, and decrease is cost. Learning first, doing next and if possible I will contribute.<hr>
<b>Paul Ardeleanu</b>:  (<a href="http://www.saperas.com">Saperas</a>) Agile is the way forward for developers working together with and for their clients. It does work and the results are above the expectations. Prepare yourself to be amazed!<hr>
<a href="mailto:nicolasconnault@gmail.com">Nicolas Connault</a>:  (Connault Solutions) I have always tried to adhere to similar principles, but I have recently discovered better ways, and a more concise and parsimonious philosophy to support my practices, through the agile manifesto.<hr>
<b>Dave Teare</b>:  (<a href="http://tearesolutions.com">TSS Inc.</a>) I never understood Agile until I meet Ruby on Rails.  Now I&#39;m actually able to put Eric Evans Domain Driven Design into practice.<hr>
<b>Kwan Hon Luen</b>.<hr>
<b>Venugopal B</b>.<hr>
<b>George Nauman</b>: I have recently moved back to a &#39;Dilbertesque&#39; environment after almost seven years helping to build an agile group within our (much) larger corporation.  While it has only been to weeks since the move, I have found it to be an excruciating experience to this point.  I know that is my attitude and perspective and to change it quickly, as well as to &#39;infect&#39; parts of the larger organization with the agile way of thinking.<hr>

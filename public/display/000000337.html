<b>Aparna Renganathan</b>: Agile values are simple and easy to understand but so hard to put into practice unless we make the mindset change. I truly believe in being Agile than just doing the ceremonies prescribed in various frameworks. Agile is the best thing that happened to IT!<hr>
<b>Stephen W Missett</b>:  (Toltech) <td width="233"><b>Bradley Goff</b>: After 20 years in IT and software development I have found a style that works for me and my customer base. Rework is at an all time low while customer acceptance is at an all time high.

<a href="mailto:abhijeet.nikte@hotmail.com">Abhijeet S Nikte</a>: Greetings!

I am a lean/agile enthusiast and a practitioner of scrum, kanban and other frameworks. 

I have had a profound effect of the agile manifesto as well as the twelve principles. I constantly attempt to learn from this community and contribute to the best of my abilities.

Kindly, consider adding me to the list of people signing the Agile Software Development Manifesto.

Collectively there is a lot of greater good that we are all bringing in to this world.

Thank you!

<a href="mailto:patricia.seemann@the3amgroup.com">patricia seemann</a>:  (the 3am group) These principles have a much wider applications than software. For firms operating in VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) territory (and that is pretty much everybody) these principles are a MUST. 
What a great piece of work!<hr>
<b>Chirag K C</b>: I propose a toast, to the Agile Manifesto. May we focus more on the items on the left, than on the items on the right. Also adding that self organizing teams are the best fit for an Agile Software Development process.

Cheers!<hr>

Through my work at Prosoft Nearshore, I see first hand the benefits of the agile approach to software development every single day. Not only does an agile development approach generate higher quality, but the software development work gets done more efficiently. Also, many people seem to get more satisfaction from the agile scrum environment due to better communication, collaboration and project planning. At Prosoft Nearshore, we offer agile outsourcing services. Our software developers embrace the agile methodology, and are conveniently located nearshore in Latin America. We work with many U.S. companies, partnering with their internal dev teams to offer increased bandwidth and velocity. Agile methods enable our software engineers to be active members of the software development team, participating and even leading daily scrum meetings, and working very effectively with their onshore team members. <hr>

Although it&#39;s very hard to follow in practice, the time I have invested in learning and practicing the agile principles, resulted in much better quality in my work and moreover much higher value for the customer. I am thankful to the authors!  <hr>

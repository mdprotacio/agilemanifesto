Agile methodology frees us from the shackles of bureaucracy and concentrates on getting things done.

Spread the word!<hr>
<b>Conversión Magro</b>:  (<a href="http://www.athelia.com">Athelia Solutions</a>) To control and manage software teams is just as hard and dynamic as software development. Agile provide teams a guide to collaborate in a creative and free environment, making everyone&#39;s life easier, from developers to managers. It helps people commit on their own goals. And of course this produce better software.<hr>
<a href="mailto:pradnk@gmail.com">Pradeep.N.Kaushik</a>: I am a professional and also a student trying to learn Agile methods and am very interested in the same. It truly overcomes some of the basic flaws in traditional waterfall driven approaches.<hr>
<b>George Haden</b>: As a business analyst who has designed several systems, I have yet to find a customer who would rather have perfect UML artifacts than a system that meets his needs.

The key to this methodology seems to be customer-oriented thinking - success is defined as a working system at the end of the project, not just meeting the required deliverables list.  As long as a customers understands that significant change can mean significant cost, and the cost metrics are agreed upon in advance, then the iterative process can succeed in delivering true value - a system that morphed into what the customer wants as he watched and guided its growth instead of an exhaustively designed system that gets implemented like a boulder rolling down hill, right over the client&#39;s needs.<hr>

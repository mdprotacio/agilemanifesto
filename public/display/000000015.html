I have a feeling that much of the fundamental concepts of &#39;agile&#39; can however be traced back to Federick Brooks concepts in Man-Mythical-Month. Especially the chapter on Silver Bullet and after.<hr>

<a href="mailto:hsharif@pacbell.net">Hassan M. Sharif</a>:  (ExtendEnt, Inc.) This is such a great movement.  At the Senior Director/CTO level for Global 500 enterprises, for years I have been practicing the principles expressed in your manifesto.  It is nice to know that we finally have a movement that makes sense not only from a common-sense point of view, but also from an economic, practical application.

In a world where we basically blow $18 billion in failed software projects annually, the Agile principles are significant markers along the way to not only save money, but to apply the most common sense principles of life to our working life!

I do wholeheartedly support your efforts and will continually strive to apply them in all aspects of my professional life!

<b>Kovács Kristóf</b>:  (<a href="http://www.kkovacs.hu/">KKovacs</a>) We programmers make the technology that enable people to provide better values to their customers by caring about individual needs, collaboration, and responding to change. Engineers do it with CAD software. Salesmen do it with their on-demand calculation software. Why would we deny access to these values ourselves?<hr>

<a href="mailto:dmarkle@opticalinnovations.com">David Markle</a>:  (Optical Innovations, Inc.) Using this methodology we delivered an eProcurement solution in 6 weeks with 3 developers.  The end-clients were ecstatic, the board of directors gave us a pat on the back, and we moved on the next project knowing we had accomplished something special.  Agile. 

The failed project that proceeded this one lasted over three years, wasted millions of dollars, and alienated clients.  Traditional. 

Enough said. <hr>
<b>Fabio Pettinati</b>:  (<a href="http://www.voreas.com">Voreas, Inc.</a>) I have been practicing the principles of agile programming for quite a while with increased success compared to status quo practices.

In our company, we implemented a similar methodology, called &quot;Wind Rose&quot;, that encompasses the main principles of agile programming, as well as in-depth client involvement and collaborative specification and reviews.

In these times of economic uncertainty, agile programming can be a signficant factor in increasing a project&#39;s ROI, not to mention its chance of suceeding.<hr>
<b>Johnny Howland</b>:  (DoDDS Pacific) I&#39;m behind you 100%<td width="233"><a href="mailto:agile.deller@smsail.com">Steven Deller</a>:  (Smooth Sailing LLC) A long while back, I had the idea of developing software using a defect tracking tool from the very start of the project. The idea was to start with a single defect, to wit &quot;The system does not work.&quot;.  Then using defect factoring, repeatedly refine the defect descriptions until they were specific capabilities, such as &quot;The system does not synchronize with the satelite signal.&quot;.  

Once a defect was sufficiently factored, a test could be written for that defect. Then the defect would be worked on (and effort tracked by defect) until there was software that passed the defect-exposing test.  
      
That process seemed &quot;obviously elegant&quot; to me.  After all, when there is no software, there is one huge defect :-).  But this in the mid-70s and it was too radical for anyone to consider it.
      
Imagine my delight on finding Martin Fowler&#39;s discussions on XP and then tracking the Web to this site.  The &quot;agile software&quot; ideas all resonate with me.   (Whether I write a defect and then write a test, or write a test and thus have a defect because the test fails is a moot distinction.)
      
In my 30 years of programming, I have frequently used Agile programming principles and techniques.  (I don&#39;t pretend that I codified the ideas as well as the Agile Alliance, but do believe I&#39;ve been on the same track.)
      
I&#39;ve got some war stories where the Agile programming techniques used only partly and without the clear descriptions at this site, nonetheless resulted in extraordinary successes.
      
I am curious though, how design and code inspections might fit with XP and Agile techniques.  Inspections (Fagen-like) have been a mainstay in my successful software endeavors from the start.  The interactions in a properly run inspection rapidly meld a group of programmers into a team with common goals.  

Perhaps &quot;Test Inspections&quot; might be appropriate for XP :-).

<a href="mailto:john.zoetebier@transparent.co.nz">John Zoetebier</a>:  (<a href="http://www.transparent.co.nz">Transparent Systems</a>) How true the Agile Manifesto is can only be appreciated after having worked in many projects for many organisations. A saying in one of the companies was &quot;For a good programmers the specs fit on the size of a cigarette box&quot;. I do not promote smoking, but agree with the spirit of the statement. I have seen project managers produce nothing but paperwork without any concrete result. 
I have seen managers driving companies insane by enforcing Service Level Agreements between departments of the same company. 
After many years I discovered one single factor for the succes of any project: the talent of a few people in a project. This more than anything else counted for the succes of the project and the organization.

There seems to be an almost religious believe in many companies that procedures, manuals and contracts lead to good systems. Nothing could be further away from the truth.
I have witnessed over and over again: the Agile Manifesto is what makes a project tick. <hr>
<b>Jay Bitsack</b>:  (ACORE) Most everyone knows what God&#39;s first equation is.  Now, we have an inkling of what His second is likely to be...  Agility = Speed + Flexibility.  That is, this type of collaborative thinking and associated team effort is capable of moving the world toward a new era in terms of elevating man&#39;s ability to translate information into action (aka leverage knowledge).  In conjunction with the on-going evolution of Web Services, the potential here appears to be enormous.  Consequently, I look forward to following and supporting the development of this revolutionary capability.<hr>
<a href="mailto:olav.maassen@itis.nl">Olav Maassen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.itis.nl">Itis J-solutions</a>) Software should do what it is intended for: it should make work easier.
Agile is a step to keep developers honest about this goal.</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000014.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

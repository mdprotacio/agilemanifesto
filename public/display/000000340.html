<b>Sony Shahani</b>.<hr>
<b>Robert Armstrong</b>:  (Robert-Armstrong.com) We don&#39;t build projects, we build products.

To me this is why Agile makes sense -  constantly reviewing, adapting and  delivering valuable product, over the products entire lifecycle not just the length of the project. 

Focusing on what stakeholder want, embracing the fact we don&#39;t known everything when we start a complex task, and not getting distracted by trying to plan things we simple don&#39;t know yet... 

Concentrating our time and effort into the things we do understand, and that we know deliver real value to the stakeholders.<hr>

As I learned about and implemented the core tenets of Agile over the years there were several concepts where a light bulb went on and I said &quot;Ah Ha!  I’ve never thought of it that way before!&quot;  For most of them I found that the underlying principles of Agile were things I was aware of and using to greater or lesser degree (depending on the organization) but there are some really useful ideas promoted by the Agile Community on how to technically approach topics from requirements gathering to development and test that when applied help deliver the benefits that Agile promises.<hr>
<b>Rosendo Lopez</b>: Believer since 2006. Proved effective since then in countless projects/organizations. It is not hard to sell, is hard to change mind biases but it always delivers, and delivers good.<hr>
<b>Aridane Álamo Morera</b>:  (mundiaudit.com) After 15 years of software analysis and development i&#39;ve came to some of the same conclusions supported by the agile manifesto.

Now i have been using agile methodologies for about 3 years, not only i had been able to stay on time in all my projects but i am also delivering more to the customer. 

The manifesto and many experts gave me the tools, arguments and confidence to be able to convince customers and managers to switch to agile methodologies... Now I am CTO.<hr>
<b>Srivas Seetharaman</b>:  (ACMIT GmBH) Though, I am still a beginner, I do believe the manifesto has a visionary rather than a missionary approach. <hr>
<b>Andrew Graham</b>: Too long in the tooth now to be using anything else!<hr>
<b>Alberto Saito</b>: I fervently believe in the advantages of working in self-organized, highly communicative, motivated, and fully engaged teams, that are able to respond to change as a way to add value to their customers.<hr>
<a href="mailto:marshc@corning.com">Cindy Marsh</a>:  (Corning, Inc.) I absolutely support the Agile Manifesto - it is stated perfectly!<hr>
<a href="mailto:jb.neuhaus@gmail.com">Jean-Baptiste Neuhaus</a>.<hr>
<b>Sharmila</b>: As a product manager I have found immense satisfaction working in an Agile team. We transitioned from Waterfall to Agile a few years ago and are moving from strength to strength. The team is growing and maturing through this process. There is more interaction and its great collaboration!</td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000339.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

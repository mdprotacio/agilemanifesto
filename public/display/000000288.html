<a href="mailto:ahmed_kharian@hotmail.com">muhammad ahmed</a>: I have found agile software development as a very flexible and development friendly method which also satisfies customers with early delivery of working software and providing flexibility of changing requirements also.<hr>
<a href="mailto:christopher.coram@paradigmAgnostics.co.uk">Chris Coram</a>:  (Paradigm Agnostic) Agile is not a process.  It is a work ethos for productive engineers under any development process.<hr>
<b>Des O Dea</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ircona.com/">Ircona</a>) I was initially doubtful about the effectiveness of this methodology, but, having spent the last 2.5 years immersed in it and being part of multiple successful and timely incremental releases, I quickly beacme a believer!<hr>
<a href="mailto:lilew@mac.com">Lisa Dominy</a>: Thank you for this manifesto, it is what I have been wanting from the first day I was introduced into the corporate world of IT.

Especially to collaboration over contract negotiation. :)<td width="233"><b>Steven S. Martin</b>:  (<a href="http://www.nebraskablue.com">CEO, Blue Cross Blue Shielf of Nebraska</a>) We have integrated Six Sigma and Lean methods into our culture over the last decade.  Agile was introduce a few years ago and has spread through our culture faster than I thought possible. The best metaphor I can think of post Agile is like living for years under a clouded sky and suddenly having &quot;sunlight&quot; burst through the clouds. The &quot;enlightment&quot; of Agile has increased product quality and speed to market and has built stronger, trust based teams across our enterprise.  Returning to our old methods is not an option.<hr>
<b>Mostafa Favaedi</b>:  (<a href="http://en.etadbir.com/">Tadbirpardaz Computer Group</a>) I love agile development<hr>
<b>Ben Castleton</b>:  (<a href="http://www.partners.org/">Partners Healthcare</a>) In developing applications for the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization, I have found it of inestimable benefit to value the items on the left more than those on the right of the manifesto.  To a large extent, these principles also create meaningful benefits in my work as an analyst and privately in my endeavors to be a good father, a good husband, and a reasonable person in general.<hr>

<a href="mailto:m.miller.4227@gmail.com">Mary Miller</a>:  (Unitedweb) I recently had the honor of being in a SCRUM Master training course that was instructed by Mike Beedle. 

Having been a long-time believer in and implementer of Agile development methodologies, I greatly appreciated the real-world examples and first-hand knowledge and expertise that Mike incorporated in the class.

I see Agile methodologies as ideal for not only development but other areas of the business, such as corporate strategic planning and marketing.<hr>

<a href="mailto:dalmeida@raysindia.com">Derek Almeida</a>:  (<a href="http://www.raysindia.com">Rays TechServ Pvt. Ltd.</a>) It&#39;s amazing how long we&#39;ve been doing software development a certain way that was inherited from various methodologies but customized to work for us, and then someone comes along and provides the agile manifesto and principles giving us the reason &quot;why&quot; we do things the way we are doing it, and structure on &quot;How&quot; to perform and improve on the way we do it. The agile methodology works. Thank you.<hr>

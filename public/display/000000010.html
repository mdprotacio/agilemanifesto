Murphy</a>:  (Enterasys Networks Inc.) This seems and excellent way of describing what market forces and mangement is demanding of software applicatoins today and helps to give a frame work that the team  involed in bringing a software release to a shipping state can follow.  I have found this to be a quite helpful theory of rapid development that removes many of the barriers to &quot;can&#39;t&quot; while at the same time provides a simple layout of why we can.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Jeff@TheJeffMiller.com">Jeff Miller</a>:  (<a href="http://www.thejeffmiller.com">Jeff Miller Associates, Inc.</a>) I first came across XP a few years ago when I was CIO at TeliSmart.com. After a very pleasant evening at Old Chicago with Ron Jeffries, I knew they were on to something!

I first started deploying these agile concepts over 15 years ago. Back then, we did not have a name for them, but (as with most of the rest of you, I&#39;m sure) I recall thinking how wasteful and futile was the effort of writing comprehensive program specs. Why not, I wondered, just have the user tell the programmer what he wants? Seemed simple enough.

Turns out is really /is/ that simple! As most of us have come to recognize, there is a certain efficient way of doing things. The Agilists (to coin a term) have codified them and expressed them in a very simple and coherent way. That is why so many of us read these pages and feel like shouting &quot;At last! Someone has put it all together!&quot;

The bottom line for me is that Agile development is better in every way: Cheaper, faster, better. <hr>

<a href="mailto:me@markbruce.com">Mark Bruce</a>:  (<a href="http://www.markbruce.com">MarkBruce</a>) The only thing permanent is change.  Developers and Customers adapting to change while creating quality solutions in a timely and accurate manner in a highly collaborative environment...  Well that what its all about.  And I&#39;m all for Agility and the XP way!<hr>

As Software Engineers, we&#39;ve had really enough - incomptent coding, exploding budgets, unforecasted breakdowns, so on - every possible negative phenomenon - that leads to the profession&#39;s disgrace. Only such a movement as Agile that has a manifesto as stated here, could be a hope of revival of the glory of a career as a Software Engineer.<hr>

Nowadays, I am in charge of promoting agile
software development in the agency of EDS

based on Semler&#39;s principles.<hr>

<b>Adithya Raghunathan</b>:  (JWM Partners, LLC) Having had both an enjoyable and successful experience with XP, I am in full agreement with the Agile Manifesto, which, although perhaps demanding more for a programmer in the short-term, delivers a much more fulfilling and effective experience.<hr>

When I discovered &quot;heavy project management&quot; I thought I had been doing it wrong all these years and that this was the right way to do projects.
Many failures later I re-discovered the value of common sense, of not testing the depth of water with both feet, of feeling your way, your client&#39;s way and the stakeholders&#39; way through the problem.
In short, agile development.<hr>

<b>James Darrah</b>:  (DTM Corporation) We have been delivering 2 software releases a year, on schedule, on budget with low bug counts while increasing customer satisfaction and eliminating over time.  We have been practicing the principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto prior to encountering it.  I would add the following values:
1) contributors over heros
2) customer requests over system expertise<hr>

I&#39;ve promoted XP for a few years.  Where is the history?  When did it start?  I am also seeking links to similar and related methodologies. I am borrowing the ideas here for extreme collaboration at http://WikiWorld.com .  Do stop by and share.

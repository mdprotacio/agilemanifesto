<a href="mailto:jamal@whiztec.com">Jamal</a>:  (<a href="http://www.whiztec.com">WHIZTEC.COM</a>) We have been using extreme programming and agile software development process since 2002! We found it the best and fastest way to get our web based ERP product matured. We created a web based extranet framework to interact with the customers and partners (we call it software supply chain). All the interactions among stakeholders are recorded. Now we are planning to launch the framework as product to help the software companies!!!
Best wishes for the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<b>Gaurav Mittal</b>:  (Apnatek) This technology is something which is gaining momentum but still time is needed before it becomes widely acceptable in industry.<hr>
<a href="mailto:petersevier@cal.berkeley.edu">Peter Sevier</a>:  (<a href="http://www.petersevier.com">http://www.petersevier.com</a>) As a QA Engineer with 8 years of experience testing software, I have found that Agile is a fresh approach to software development. I am currently seeking a Software Quality Assurance Engineer position with a software company in the Silicon Valley/San Francisco Bay Area that practices Agile.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rajivnayan.gupta@wipro.com">Rajivnayan Gupta</a>: I would like to sign it for Process approach and requirement gathering functionality during software development for this approach.

<b>Rex Bigger</b>:  (<a href="http://www.cabiritech.com">Cabiri Technologies Ltd</a>) I cannot believe that individuals who have not looked at Agile would not then use it. Agile is the commonsense approach to software development.<hr>

<a href="mailto:wagner@lvdesign.com.br">Wagner Montalvão</a>:  (<a href="http://www.lvdesign.com.br">LV Design</a>) I am applying Agile Software Development from what I am learning with the Extreme Programming. Everything I can say for now is that these deals are working pretty good for me. Thank you all for your collaboration and congratulations for the good job. Count on me for anything I can do to enhance you all too. Best regards! WM<hr>
<b>Paul Sisco</b>: I have been pushing agile development for years. 
The major point of frustration most development teams face is when the items on the right are more important than those on the left. Let&#39;s reverse that, and enjoy what we do. 
Here&#39;s to having fun while creating great software...<td width="233"><b>Susan M. Fernandez</b>: Having served as the project manager for more than a dozen releases developed with Agile SDLC, it works!

From my experience, relationships between IT and its customers have improved, because of the collaboration, as well as the faster turn-around of software that better meets client&#39;s needs.  <hr>

<a href="mailto:jhosmer@lightyeardt.com">John Hosmer</a>:  (<a href="http://www.lightyeardt.com">LightYear Dealer Technologies</a>) I have believed this for over 20 years.  I have very strong feelings about this for the auto dealership DMS market.  Agile beats fragile.<hr>

<a href="mailto:radu.tanasa@lightwaysoftware.com">Radu Andrei Tanasa</a>:  (<a href="http://www.lightwaysoftware.com">SC Lightway Software SRL</a>) Agile development has given a real advantage to small teams and its proven flexibility resembles the one from the well known martial art, Aikido.

<b>Adeel Ali</b>: Agile Manifesto points out some really common sense things that were missing in the IT industry. I guess its easier to look at these things as an after thought. I really appreciate the effort and experience of all the contributors to this manifesto. This is definitely a step in the right direction.<td width="233"><b>Srinivas Chappidi</b>:  (<a href="http://www.Microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>) The manifesto comprises the very key factors that make a project successful when adopting Agile dev process.

<a href="mailto:johngale@shaw.ca">John Gale</a>: This manifesto reflects what I have always believed about software development. My training is in formal systems analysis using the Life Cycle method.  This training happened in the days of COBOL.  I was fortunate enough to have people around me at that time that believed in these principles, even though there was no formal statement of them.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jorge.aguilar@upaep.mx">jorge aguilar cisneros</a>:  (<a href="http://www.upaep.mx">UPAEP</a>) If we want to try with a new paradigm about sottware development, we can use agile methods!.<hr>

<a href="mailto:broadcast.account@gmail.com">Mul</a>:  (<a href="http://www.nab.com.au">National Australia Bank</a>) Agile formalises the way in which effective developers already work - it simply gives them a mandate to do what they do well.

And this mindset even expands the scope of software development as the same philosophy / principles apply to innovation / new business development in general.<hr>

<b>Karl Fisch</b>:  (<a href="http://texterfolg.de">ProTag Kreativagentur</a>) Project-related documentation gets a whole new meaning in the &quot;agile&quot; development methodologies. I think that&#39;s good and right. The agile development path is human-centered and that is meaningful and forward-looking. I support this way in every word of the manifesto.<hr>

<b>mishal alharbi</b>: I Support the Agile Manifesto!<td width="233"><a href="mailto:amit@gritinnovation.com">Amit Gauba</a>:  (<a href="http://gritinnovation.com">Grit Innovation</a>) Consider if we 
- Began with the End in sight, and Customer using the product, and its output. Giving feedback, (and paying) !
- We would then correct, re-align marketing &amp; sales - to get more of these &#39;right&#39; customers (paying us and demanding from us).  More of customers and more of feedbacks
- we would then fix / align our outputs, out activities, our focus, our methods, our effort, our measurements, our skills

Lets discover and fix, weekly, daily, hourly.
Lets be AGILE and lets fulfill and not waste !

<b>Doug Villella</b>: I find that positive customer interactions and the feeling of personal accomplishment to be extremely motivating to this process. This methodology and philosophy are excellent tools for process-oriented people who are more comfortable with well-defined roles, but know that life is chaotic and reality daunting. I&#39;m sure there are some people who would wish that all aspects of life be predictable and known - but why would anyone want to live such a boring and non-eventful life? Agile shows introverts and extroverts are able to work together on amazing projects, and some of the best software in the world is still being worked on today. I wish that every company with a software development group, required their upper management executives to attend classes about how this system works. It would be very eye-opening to see how wrong most or all of them would be about their conception of how software should be developed.<hr>

<a href="mailto:petersmello@gmail.com">PETER BERNDT DE SOUZA MELLO</a>:  (<a href="http://www.scrumsmart.org">ScrumSmart</a>) Agile methods and dynamic resource scheduling are my true North to better Project Management, not only for IT development.

Peter Mello, PMP, PMI-SP, SpS<td width="233"><b>Srinivasan Balaji</b>:  (<a href="http://www.sherpasoftware.com">Sherpa Software</a>) We have been developing products to solve information management challenges for over 13 years. And since we controlled and managed our own development, scope creep was rampant and release schedules fluid. In addition to leaving the development team frustrated, unmet delivery dates often made planning our marketing and sales efforts daunting. In a bid to improve our processes, we adopted Agile&#39;s Scrum methodology about 3 years ago and have since seen a marked improvement in production. The short sprint cycles, the transparency, the need for accountability from all involved and strict adherence to scope and timelines has caused a dramatic turnaround in our development team&#39;s output and more importantly in setting reliable expectations for the rest of the organization. We are a &quot;Scrum shop&quot; now and swear by its simple yet very effective framework.<hr>

<b>ahmed amin</b>: This is how modern software development should be done.<hr>
<a href="mailto:boraseabhi@gmail.com">Abhijit N Borase</a>:  (Sr. Engineer - General Motors) Agile simplifies the difficult Software development process. Roles and responsibilities of every individual are very clear. 

Continuous communication (daily scrum calls) between feature team and product owner ensures delivering the right quality of work.

Also as it is said, &quot;change is inevitable&quot; agile makes it possible to adapt or to accommodate new change requirements from product owner.

In my opinion, &quot;AGILE IS HEALTHY WAY OF DOING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT&quot;<hr>
<b>Cynthia Glace</b>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ralf@bensmann.com">Ralf Bensmann</a>:  (<a href="http://www.art-of-coding.eu">art of coding UG</a>) This mental attitude and kind of collaboration is key to success for software development and other projects. Different people like stakeholders, architects and developers must work &quot;together&quot; on a project in a reasonable and productive manner.<hr>
<a href="mailto:developer@zedorian.de">Bernhard Heinrich</a>: I can say from experience: Longterm-planned software projects fail! 

Agile Software projects also fail, but with lesser losses. 

Agile projects have a real chance to succeed and to generate profit.<hr>

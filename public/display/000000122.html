<a href="mailto:steve.dupuis@mail.com">Steven Dupuis</a>:  (SGC/EDP Consultants INC) I agree completely with the philosophy of Agile development. It will take a lot of convincing to get people to work out of their comfort zones (waterfall development) .. I&#39;ve been trying to implement agile techniques in small projects that have multiple phases so that successes with it can be built upon.

What amuses me is that the use of Yourdon - Gane &amp; Sarson Structured Techniques in the late 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s promoted the same philosophy. I know this because I was there and tried to get these techniques used in small projects too.

We were successful with a few, but at that time the majority of systems analysts were too lazy to learn these new techniques. I believe the same situation exists today. Not very many people want to move to new methods owing to the amount of work involved. Thinking requires a great deal of effort.

Around and around and around we go.

<b>vidhya</b>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:pjha6@csc.com">Pawan Jha</a>:  (<a href="http://www.CSC.com">CSC</a>) Agile methods usually produce less written documentation than other methods. Agile means being able to quickly change direction.It includes writing tests for functionality before coding
It is cool. I love it .<hr>
<b>Christopher Dambamuromo</b>:  (<a href="http://www.cdsm.co.uk">CDSM</a>) Whilst the Agile methods fit well in a culture of low criticality, small project teams with a larger composition of senior developers and where requirements evolve rapidly and quite often, with large projects they however become extremely difficult to adpot due to the reluctance of large team developers to move out of their comfort zone (waterfall methods). This, of course is debatable.<hr>
<b>Phil Clooth</b>:  (<a href="http://www.gfu.net/s787.html">GFU Cyrus AG</a>) The GFU Cyrus AG in Cologne supports Agile Software Developement in many ways and tries to convince its seminar participants to follow this path by offering courses and organizing events dealing especially with Agile Software development.<hr>

<a href="mailto:paulking@paulking.com">Paul R. King</a>:  (<a href="http://www.agentek.com">Agentek</a>) <td width="233"><b>Richard McLean</b>: It is great to see this intuitive strategy formalized.  Substituting constant interaction with customers and business owners is extremely efficient and effective; it produces great software and unprecedented customer acceptance.  The frequent updates have helped my user base (wireless provider) be responsive in a very competitive market.  Continuous improvement provides the essence of more laborious controls with the advantage of faster implementation.  The emphasis on functionality over documentation is what users as programmers both prefer.  Thanks for the leadership.<hr>
<a href="mailto:brian.lukowski@charter.net">Brian Lukowski</a>:  (BLV) I should have signed the Agile Manifesto years ago but I didn&#39;t believe it would matter. I was wrong. Putting ones name on a document means everything. It changes something inside you...creating a new motivation to adopt the principles until they are second nature. It also let&#39;s others know they are not alone. Signing creates solidarity within the profession which leads to courage. And courage leads to change - which is what the Manifesto is all about!<hr>

<a href="mailto:fermin.saez@gmail.com">Fermin Saez de Andres</a>: I adhere to the Agile movement on the conviction that it reflects the philosophy I try to follow when confronted to any project: A method can garantee a good result as long as it does not interfere with the ability to adapt that nature has given us. 
If the method is too strict, it will only be helpfull if change doesn&#39;t happen. But we know change does happen. If we just follow our intuition, it will take many failures until we learn how to do things well. Yet too many failures can lead to not having the oportunity to try again at all. 
Nature has given us the tools to succeed: We are social beings, have analytical minds and are capable of adapting to almost any kind of environment.
I believe by applying the principles in the Agile Manifesto we can reach success for our projects.<hr>
<a href="mailto:wilma@places-to-be.nl">Wilma Reints</a>:  (<a href="http://www.places-to-be.nl">Places To Be</a>) Our effort to create(4D)experiences for collaborative working fully support the Agile SD Manifesto.

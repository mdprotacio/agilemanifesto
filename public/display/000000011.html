<b>Ray Anderson</b>:  (<a href="http://www.bango.net">Bango.net Limited</a>) The benefits of Mobility are profound.  Agile development should help us home in on getting those benefits to users by collaboration rather than diktat.<hr>

<a href="mailto:galleman@niwotridge.com">Glen B Alleman</a>:  (<a href="http://www.niwotridge.com">Niwot Ridge Consulting</a>) The risks in the selection, procurement, and deployment of large scale COTS systems are greatly reduced through the use of agile methods. Applying agilty in this domain is a natural evolution from high-ceromony processes of the past. Agilty provides a systematic vision of the outcome - an intelligent set of actions that make it possible to connect the COTS requirments with their outcomes in a rapid and sustainable manner.<hr>

Improving the quality of the work, improves the quaility of our product, and our passion for and enjoyment of software development<hr>
<a href="mailto:jheffron@mindtool-usa.com">John Heffron</a>:  (MindTool, Inc.) In 25 years of developing software, I have had the good fortune to be involved in many projects that worked closely with the user/sponsors, that used short, frequent delivery cycles, that created only enough artifacts other than the software itself to suffice. In every case, projects that put people first, functioning software second, and everything else far after generated superior products and higher customer--and developer--satisfaction than projects dominated by strict adherence to schedules, budgets, or processes. The agile philosophy is the only way to create software with soul.<hr>
<a href="mailto:tms@stambaugh-inc.com">Tom Stambaugh</a>:  (<a href="http://www.stambaugh-inc.com">Stambaugh Engineering, Inc.</a>) Every successful methodology is ultimately Agile. The question is how much energy we waste getting there.<hr>

<b>David J. Quinn</b>: A &#39;home-grown&#39; agile development proponent, having learned the value of these tenets not in classes and seminars, but through real-life application of the principles.
Non-agile development is arrested development.<hr>

<b>Paul Slootweg</b>: I am about to start work on an project using agile development to achieve its goals.
I&#39;m looking forward to living and breathing the manifesto.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ajai_kurian@indiatimes.com">Ajai Kurian</a>:  (<a href="Http://www.grasshopperindia.com">Grasshopper Infotech</a>) I am very much amazed to see this idea in a site which i was very much confused to move further with my imagination of doing projects almost the same sort.Now i am very confident in going ahead with this great way software development.<hr>
<a href="mailto:cleve@clevebrown.com">Cleve Brown</a>:  (<a href="http://www.clevebrown.com">CleveBrown.com</a>) As a developer whose practice evolved from a history that spans OOAD, RUP, and XP, I am a strong proponent of an agile approach.

The Manifesto represents the forefront of the science of software development. It captures the heart of what drives an effective project in the fewest possible words, incidentally reinforcing its own message. Bravo.

Unfortunately, it highlights the weaknesses that are still so prevalent on many software projects today. We still have a lot of work to do raising the industrys understanding to this level.

Many thanks for helping to push that understanding forward!<hr>
<b>Jacek Artymiak</b>:  (<a href="http://www.artymiak.com">http://www.artymiak.com</a>) If you apply the Agile Manifesto in practice, take it to meetings with new clients and hed them each a copy of it.  It&#39;s the best way to explain what they can expect from you, and what you expect from them.  When they don&#39;t get it, explain, and if they still don&#39;t get it, think if you are interested in working with them.<hr>

<a href="mailto:henrik_e_westman@yahoo.se">Henrik Westman</a>: I have tried to follow agile principles and processes, for some years now, when managing software projects.

My experience is that the projectteams have been able to deliver a great deal of business value and they have also become well-functioning teams.

It&#39;s a reliable and fun way of developing software!<hr>

<a href="mailto:hans.bossenbroek@luminis.nl">Hans Bossenbroek</a>:  (<a href="http://www.luminis.nl">Luminis</a>) After a period of employment with large consultancy firms, a group and colleagues/friends and myself reached the conclusion that underrating the complexity and added-value of software engineering is one of the most important sources for failures.

In order to remain free from all kinds of internal hassle regarding strategy, corporate standards and alliances, we founded a small consultancy firm aimed at applying and extending the agile (or extreme) ideas for customers.

It is our firm believe that it takes professionals to help professionals and short term help (fly in, shit all over the place and fly out) does not amount to much. We therefore work using a combination of participation, education, longer term coaching and management support.<hr>

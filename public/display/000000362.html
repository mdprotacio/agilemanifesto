“During two decades working in enterprise-software-development, I never saw teams so engaged, so happy and self-effective. This is perceivable at product-house level, team level and in the face of each individual team member. That really rocks!”

* An amuse-bouche [aˌmyzˈbuʃ] (plural amuse-bouches) or amuse-gueule [aˌmyzˈɡœl] is a single, bite-sized hors d’œuvre. ~Wikipedia<hr>

<a href="mailto:ceottaki@gmail.com">Felipe Ceotto</a>.<td width="233"><b>Allen Higgins</b>:  (University College Dublin) I certainly agree with and adhere to the principles of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, although I&#39;d more refer to myself as an aficionado of Extreme Programming. 
I first encountered it in 1999, I was working in Dublin in a company with some very &#39;switched on&#39; people in positions of responsibility and it was partially through them and through the grapevine and then later when Kent Beck came to Ireland and talked with us that it all came together for me.<hr>
<a href="mailto:steven.barrett@iinet.net.au">Steve Barrett</a>: It works, adopting an agile mindset guided by the 4 values and 12 principles improves outcomes, it feels a more natural and a happier way of working and is a great way to manage risk in software delivery (but equally applies to other endeavours in and outside of technology)<hr>
<b>Dan Hamilton</b>:  (Emagineers) <hr>
<a href="mailto:clebermpce@gmail.com">Cleber Oliveira Silva</a>: The agile method can change the view about the SW Development, and also other areas of knowledge.<hr>
<a href="mailto:aska.ryo@gmail.com">Clifford Zhou</a>:  (IBM) many people adopt some of the agile practices and then announced they are agile. It&#39;s not correct. All of our goals were identified in Agile Manifesto with 12 principles. If someone only adopt those practice as a goal, with not respect the agile manifesto, they are just fake agile, I think <hr>

<b>Robert Floyd</b>:  (Interactive Data Systems) My company has been following agile software development principles since our inception in 1992. Our consistent success in delivering working software on time and under budget is largely due to our consistent commitment to agile development principles.  Without question following agile principles has been a critical success factor in both our longevity and competitive advantage. <hr>

<a href="mailto:mike_fosh@yahoo.com">Mikhail Levin</a>: agile vision

self improving adaptive learning AI system will substitute Development Team one day, leaving Agile Mastery and Product Ownership to creativity and intuition of human mind. manifestation of Agile principles opens road to &#39;no coding&#39; IT product development, allowing to dedicate the most valuable asset, Human Intellect, to Vision Implementations instead of Problem Solving.<hr>
<a href="mailto:Ashutosh.Khattri@gmail.com">ASHUTOSH KHATTRI</a>:  (Bank of America Merril Lynch) I completely relate to the Agile Manifesto.

Over the course of 15 years of large scale software development i have come to realize the importance of Adaptability, Productive collaborations, Iterative delivery and keeping it simple philosphy.

And i see these values getting delivered in the last 10 years of my following Scrum based Agile development.


* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
* Working software over comprehensive documentation 
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
* Responding to change over following a plan <hr>
<a href="mailto:agile@sforeman.com">Steve Foreman</a>: As a Software Engineering Manager I agree that software should be developed in an Agile way and should be transparent.  The process should constantly be reviewed for ways to improve.

Software should always meet business needs and the only way to ensure this in a world where business needs change is by using an Agile approach.

Agile also helps to promote a more stable and safe environment for developers.<hr>

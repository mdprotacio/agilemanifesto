<a href="mailto:jim@fitterweb.com">Jim Keeney</a>:  (<a href="http://www.fitterweb.com">FitterWeb Consulting</a>) As change becomes a constant, adaptation is the most important competency. Agile development has proven through out my career to be the way to achieve the ability to rapidly adapt technology. 
Agile leads to a closer relationship with the customers and users. The relationship then gives teams the ability to sense the need for change faster. Agile&#39;s emphasis on working code and the technologies that implies allows for teams to handle the increasing need to change and evolve. 

In the end Agile allows organizations to front load value and grow complexity in direct relationship to the growth of the value.

<b>Boris Ruth</b>:  (<a href="http://www.familieruth.de">http://www.familieruth.de</a>) Being agile is not just the next methodology, it is a lifestyle &amp; the underlying principle of everything you do. Even without knowing about it, somehow we always &quot;felt&quot; that waterfalls &amp; ivory towers are substantially wrong. It&#39;s the people and how they inspire each other and focus on achieving a common goal that ultimately make the difference. Thank you to all of you out there who believe into this idea and make it happen every day!<hr>
<b>Juan Fernandez</b>:  (<a href="http://www.faimevi.es">Faimevi</a>) Just support the Agile Manifesto! Good way to work and improve. Thank you<hr>
<a href="mailto:russell@sandyatom.co.uk">Russell Gilbert</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sandyatom.co.uk">Sandy Atom Technology</a>) More &amp; more often I am asked, in effect, “How can we understand this really, really big problem so that we can approach solving it with certainty?” Agile doesn’t answer this question but rather poses the right question and posits the answer. The right question is “How do we manage the solution of this really, really big problem that we know we can’t understand at the start, that we know our understanding of will grow as we work at solving it and that we know will change along the way?”. Agile is the best answer to this question that I have found.<hr>
<b>BENOIT Julien</b>:  (<a href="http://twitter.com/_JulienBenoit">http://twitter.com/_JulienBenoit</a>) Agile is very important for software development. Thanks for the work you have done establishing this methodology. As developers, project lead, CTOs, ... We have to continue it.<hr>

<b>Robert Green</b>: I wish I had learned the Agile approach when I was embarking on a development of a tool for helping with data access auditing and control. This approach would have saved all the pain of writing a requirements document upfront based on assumptions. An agile approach would have ensured a better product with built in improvement process as new requirements became apparent.<hr>

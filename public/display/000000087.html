<b>Michael Lane</b>:  (<a href="http://www.delveintojesus.com">Delve Into Jesus</a>) We could not have put this project together given the cost and time constraints without the agile methodology. We&#39;re all sold on it now, and will never go back to the &quot;old&quot; way. <hr>
<a href="mailto:beaudry.marc@gmail.com">Marc Beaudry</a>:  (<a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca">Industry Canada</a>) I spent the last 3 and half years championing the adoption of the Agile Manifesto within government walls with a fair amount of success.  Today, many Canadians, unknowingly, are benefiting from that influence!

Thanks for putting the words together that allow us to build better software today and for many years (and decades) to come!<hr>

<a href="mailto:sudheer.alladi@inbox.com">Sudheer Alladi</a>: I vote for this manifesto !!!<td width="233"><b>James Pannozzi</b>:  (Independent Consultant) The conceptions promulgated by the Agile Manifesto initiative are a refreshing change from the dehumanized utilization of people as expendable resources, to be worked to the bone and then discarded like a used printer cartridge by uncaring corporate executives whoose main concern is leaving their schedules open for golf on Friday. 

With the rise of alternative operating systems comes the opportunity for individuals to regain control of their desktops and continue the wave of liberation unleashed by the desktop personal computer revolution of 30 years ago.
Maximizing the individual&#39;s productivity and ability to communicate and collaborate in a logical, relaxed, friendly and anti-organizational manner will inevitably result in completed and successful projects instead of half finished outsourced overspeced monstrosities such as what the F.B.I. got for a database several years ago for 30 million dollars which had to be discarded as unworkable.

Here&#39;s my glib quote for people trying to get their heads around this stuff...

&quot;Agile Development == Less Ceremony, More Discipline&quot;

As we know, any idea applied thoughtlessly, domatically is bound to fail.  Sometimes you DO need more of the less valued things on the right. Peronally, I believe that if you consider the values and principals for each project, and make a balanced decision based on the specific context, then you are being agile.

Please don;t apply the same formula every time, even if it does quack like an agile duck.<hr>

<b>Shaun Askey</b>: I have consistently used an agile approach over the years to obtain business benefit. 
At the time I didn&#39;t know it was Agile and it&#39;s great to now see this approach formalised and recognised.<hr>

<a href="mailto:deb.sandeep@gmail.com">Sandeep Deb</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sandeepdeb.com">http://www.sandeepdeb.com</a>) Agile is possibly the most honest thing that could have happened in the arena of software engineering methodologies. I have been practicing Agile in-principle for a couple of years now and it is just great.<hr>

<a href="mailto:adronhall@gmail.com">Adron Hall</a>:  (<a href="http://www.adronbhall.name">Three Step Solutions</a>) Been there, focused on the processes and tools, the comprehensive documentation, contract negotiation, and following a plan and have seen to much failure.  It is not fun nor interesting to fail, only useful to know what to avoid.  Thus I now know and look forward to the principles of focus on the other side of the paradigm.<hr>

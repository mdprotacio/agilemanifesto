<a href="mailto:stephan.wiesebach@siemens.com">Stephan Wiesebach</a>:  (<a href="http://www.siemens.com">Siemens AG</a>) After long and heavy fights between the process gurus representing the light-, heavy- or middleweight processes we now have a metaphor to support &quot;common-sense-behaviour&quot; in software projects. IMHO the &quot;agile&quot;-metaphor complements the thoughts about improving processes with process patterns nicely.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jeckstein@acm.org">Jutta Eckstein</a>:  (<a href="http://www.jeckstein.com">Objects in Action</a>) I support the agile alliance manifesto,
because it supports finally bringing 
back the processes to the people.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ici@videotron.net">Luc Duranleau</a>:  (<a href="http://www.icidesign.com">ICI Design</a>) For many years I was psychologically harassed
for my unorthodox ways of driving software
engineering projects. I never used any
prescribed method or very elaborate
documentation schemes, especially if it
meant cutting down trees to produce 6
inch binders that quickly got lost on some
shelf.

Essentially, my approach to software
design has always been based on verbal
communication with all knowledge levels;
anyone who could enrich the comprehensive
perspective of the goals to attain and the
long term vision to respect. Always striving
to attain that momentum and motivation that
nourrishes the instinct for initiative and
willpower that inevitably determines the
success of the software endeavor. I encourage
any interaction that will enlighten those
lonely isolated software developers in their
small yet infinite kingdoms. Software design
is a crystal-like reflection of the
cohesiveness of this diversity of minds.

I am very happy to hear I am no longer alone
in this quest for simplicity of design for
simplicity of life.

<b>Sabine Noack</b>:  (<a href="http://www.4ty3.de">43 - Sabine Noack</a>) One of the most important aspects of my work as a trainer and consultant is to remind people that developing software is not simply an act of industrial production. The Agile Alliance Manifesto tells us why software development is different and what we should consider to make it successfull as well as enjoyable.   <hr>

<a href="mailto:pjm2@bellsouth.net">Patrick Morrison</a>:  (<a href="http://www.virtualpragmatics.com">Virtual Pragmatics</a>) 19 years experience programming professionally convince me that the values expressed in the agile manifesto produce the best software and the best releationships between business and techs.  The successes I&#39;ve seen in my career link to the values expressed, and the failures often tie to valuing something else.<hr>

<a href="mailto:matthieu.colas-bara@khiplea.com">Matthieu Colas-Bara</a>:  (KHIPLEA) The rules of the Agile Manifesto formalize what happens naturally when people of good will do their best to collaborate and succeed in software developpement.

<a href="mailto:arush@expershare.com">Alex Rush</a>:  (<a href="http://www.expershare.com">ExperShare</a>) I come from somewhat of a more traditionalist &quot;heavyweight&quot; development method background, and am on a constant mission to pare down to only the essential artifacts and activities necessary to deliver quality code.

<a href="mailto:ellyssian@ufie.org">Everett A. Warren</a>: The values may seem simple and commonsense, but since when was commonsense very common?  Agreeing with these values and actually putting them into practice are two different things, and I&#39;m very glad to be in a position where I can push for the latter and come up with some better software.<hr>
<a href="mailto:marquardt@acm.org">Klaus Marquardt</a>: It is no secret: in a healthy project, the process follows the people and their needs, not vice versa.
Every stakeholder in a software project can learn from this.<hr>
<b>Barry Fazackerley</b>:  (<a href="http://www.dsdm.org">DSDM</a>) As chairman of the DSDM Consortium I am proud that DSDM is associated with Agile. DSDM is built upon nine principles. The Agile values of Individuals and interactions, Working software, Customer collaboration and Responding to change align themselves very closely to the DSDM Principles.<hr>

<a href="mailto:pclark@pclark.net">Pete Clark</a>:  (<a href="http://www.pclark.net">pclark.net Consulting, LLC</a>) The ideas expressed by XP and agile methods encompass ideas that have felt right since I started managing software projects.

It&#39;s great to see more attention being paid to understanding how to make software development go in the real world - where requirements aren&#39;t fixed, where change is a fact of life, and where the development team needs all the help it can get.<hr>

<b>Robb Gilmore</b>:  (<a href="http://www.descartes.com">Descartes Systems Group</a>) Over the years, I have arrived at many of the very same conclusions that are so succinctly stated by the Agile Alliance.  It is refreshing (and much more efficient) to point colleagues to the Agile Manifesto rather than repeating the same old stump speeches time and time again!  I support the manifesto.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:grigori.melnik@sait.ab.ca">Grigori Melnik</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sait.ab.ca">Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT)</a>) Eureka!<hr>
<a href="mailto:roger_marlow@yahoo.com">Roger Marlow</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ma-p.com">m.a.partners</a>) As a software developer and more recently a development manager, my most successful projects have used aspects of Agile Methods, although I didn&#39;t have a name for it at the time. Even so, for a long time the prevailing methods were frustrating bureaucratic failures. It seemed that the common sense and essentially agile approach espoused by Fred Brooks all those years ago would fade into history while modern methodologists espoused &#39;fat book&#39; processes. Agile Methods are therefore a refreshing return to common sense basics. They bring together the best of the experiences we have all been through in software development and that we have informally known about for years. At last we have a self consistent framework for all our anecdotal evidence from successful projects. I believe that the advent of Agile Methods signal a revolution in the software development industry and promise exciting times for us all.<hr>

<a href="mailto:rboaz@msn.com">Ralph W. Boaz</a>:  (Pillar Consulting) I have filled a lot of roles in my career including software engineering, ministry, and senior management.  Agile development is a breakthrough in understanding the keys to success and failure.  It is the first to really address the people element which has been ignored for so long.  Thank you to the Agile founders.<hr>
<a href="mailto:sbechtel@newconquest.com">Scott Bechtel</a>:  (<a href="http://newconquest.com">Conquest Solutions Group</a>) After being in projects that always drag in over due it has been fun learning about this new approach!<hr>

I feel like one of those people on a talk show when I talk about Agile Development to people new to the concepts and ideals.  In all honesty, I don&#39;t know how I managed the software development process before these very practical and customer focused ideals where brought together under one banner.

We are I am certain seeing a very big change in how people approach software development and design.  

Putting the businnes need or problem above the implementation detail is a key goal in our efforts in our company.  Or as we like to generalize ... Find the &#39;Why?&#39; and the &#39;What?&#39; ... The &#39;How?&#39; is not so important.<hr>
<b>Erik Groeneveld</b>:  (<a href="http://www.cq2.nl">CQ2</a>) As consultant working in the Netherlands, I&#39;m using the AAM principles as a starting point for organizing my projects.  Amazing to see how many organizations just skip team and customer collaboration and put all their faith on heavy processes.

Yet, we could not see it, blinded as we were by our firm belief building software was like building bridges.

Thank you, folks. We feel much lighter now.<hr>

<a href="mailto:mayank@siteengineer.com">Mayank Tandon</a>:  (<a href="http://www.webmasters-india.net">Webmasters India</a>) I am still in the process of completely imbibing the ideology of Agile manifesto but it seems this is an interesting development that acknowledges the shortcomings of traditional software development models in light of their failure to take into consideration human factors while enabling a highly critical development cycle with common sense.

Would be interested in contributing whatever we can to promote the idea....<hr>

<b>Craig Dewalt</b>: I support the Agile Manifesto because I have a sincere desire to build quality, practical software on time and within budget.<hr>
<a href="mailto:m.andrews@oopl.com.au">Martin Andrews</a>:  (<a href="http://www.oopl.com.au">Object Oriented Pty. Ltd.</a>) The manifesto describes a set of values that we should all strive to encompass in our daily work.  As new ideas and techniques become popular in the changing world of software development, these values can still hold as strong underlying principles.  We should ensure that we never lose that focus.<hr>

Great !!!! Full support to this alliance is very important in the software industry.
After years reading books and experincing x-thousand methodologies in projects, it is 
time to handle directly with all problems, those known since decades.<hr>

<a href="mailto:robs@integrasoft.com">Rob Schripsema</a>:  (<a href="http://www.integrasoft.com">Integra Software and Services</a>) As critical as proper engineering, design and documentation are to the end result, they often place a stranglehold on the more creative, elegant aspects of software development. I&#39;ve struggled for years with how to balance the two sides. I fully support what the Agile Alliance is doing to help us keep the proper balance!<hr>

<a href="mailto:chris.ringrow@i2i-solutions.net">Chris Ringrow</a>:  (<a href="http://www.i2i-solutions.net">i2i</a>) I strongly agree that the key to successful
software development is the team rather than the process. However in order for that to work the team members needs to communicate effectively not only with each other but with customers, managers and investors.
At the end of the day it is good communications at all levels that makes a successful project possible.<hr>

<a href="mailto:bhowell@nassau.cv.net">Robert W. Howell</a>:  (<a href="http://www.emanageservice.com">Independant</a>) I have been using this methodology intuitively for years.  It is good to see someone finally put it down in writing.  Now I can actually put a name on it when someone asks me what mthodology I favor.  I usually work alone or with small teams (less that 5 people) and I have always followed what I called &quot;the Patented (not really) Bob Howell system of software development.&quot; ;-)  I even used this back in the early eighties when I was programming on Data General Mini&#39;s in COBOL.  When you think about it, it is really an allegory of the old &quot;The customer is always right.&quot; rule of successful business practice.

The point is I hate micro-engineering, where you try to completely spec out a project before writing one line of code.  I&#39;ve seen these projects go for two years with zero to show except reams of documents that no one can remember what they are for.  My philosophy is, get the basic business process down, then prototype and iterate.  Give the customer something to work with other than reams of specs they have to approve.  One other thing, It IS important to have a flexible software framework to build on.  I have a framework that I have used on several jobs.  It evolves some from job to job but it makes development much faster.  The framework handles things like user authentication, form and window management, etc.  Spend the time up front to engineer a framework you are comfortable with or you may end up with a code base that is unmanageable.  As a development manager that should be where you spend your time.<hr>
<a href="mailto:gerry.simblett@bigfoot.com">Gerry Simblett</a>:  (UK Freelance Developer) I am really excited by agile software development. Agile methodologies provide a win-win solution for everyone involved (except for perhaps the pointy-haired bosses of this world!). I thoroughly endorse and try to apply these principles whenever I can.<hr>

<b>Pete Hanson</b>: As an IT professional of 32 years standing, I have seen processes, tools, and documentation come and go, and there seems to be no end in sight.

I am, and have been without realizing it, a long-standing advocate of the Agile Software Development Manifesto, and am very pleased to see rationality and reality being brought back to our profession. <hr>

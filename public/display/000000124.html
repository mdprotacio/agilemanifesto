<a href="mailto:info@jamieowen.info">Jamie Owen</a>:  (<a href="http://www.jamieowen.info">http://www.jamieowen.info</a>) I see a terrific parallel: The characteristics of the relationship between an agile development team and the customers and users is much the same as those of an agile instructor and his/her responsibility toward a classroom of students.<hr>

<a href="mailto:basu.abhijeet@gmail.com">Abhijeet Basu</a>: I have studied agile development up close and personal. Though I am a Quality Analyst and most of the time an evangelist for the PDCA cycle, I believe agile gives a definitive edge in times of competetive development by increasing delivery capabilities, giving ownership to the delivery teams, helping the customer edge over competition in a very short span of time and by respecting a continual change of business requirements from the customer. Whoever said that agile is against documentation and processes has not seen the beauty, simplicity and effectiveness of controlled chaos.<hr>
<a href="mailto:deancornish@gmail.com">Dean Cornish</a>:  (<a href="http://deancornish.blogspot.com">http://deancornish.blogspot.com</a>) I support the Agile Manifesto in its heart and soul, and believe very seriously that Agility in software development is the future.

I endeavour, everyday to increase communication, to deliver value back to my customers as frequently as possible and involve them through every step of the way.

<b>Bill Forsyth</b>: For 23 years I&#39;ve done all manner of development and systems integration, and have been in just about every role except QA, including developer, architect, manager, senior manager, solutions consulting, and more. Currently I&#39;m primarily in the role of senior software designer/architect.

I&#39;m also an award winning composer, arranger, and producer. Agile principles might be called &quot;minimalism&quot; for software design -- a creative act. Minimalism and Agile are where it&#39;s at.<hr>

<a href="mailto:sukdebg@hcl.in">Sukdeb Ganguli</a>:  (HCL Technologies) With the changing business needs of the customer this can be an excellent way of delivering. May be one of the best approaches, for smaller proejcts (less than 30 Man month) and for customers with whom yo already have a long term relationship.<hr>

I always knew there was a more common-sense way off approaching projects, and there it was, all packaged and with a huge following to produce combined success!

5 years of Agile and SCRUM and still going strong evangelizing and consulting and therefore sharing my passion and Agile success with others!

Agile and SCRUM put the quality of delivery and the customer first again!<hr>

<a href="mailto:carroll.danny@heb.com">Danny Carroll</a>:  (<a href="http://www.heb.com">HEB Grocery</a>) Changing minds one person at a time and making headway.  Writing software doesn&#39;t have to be as difficult as it is.<hr>

<b>17slash Design Union</b>:  (<a href="http://17slash.com">17slash</a>) Because Agile is also a way of working on design projects!<hr>
<b>Milind Torney</b>:  (Symantec) <hr>
<b>Craig Addyman</b>:  (<a href="http://www.6packproject.com/">6packproject</a>) I wholeheartedly agree with the Manifesto. I believe that these principles show the value of the individual software craftsman. We are not an indistinguishable group of interchangeable parts, but rather a varied population of developers with individual strengths.<hr>

Heads-off to Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<b>Mike Ziegenhagen</b>:  (You're Technically Write) Agile Development has taken the world of software development by storm and led to an unprecedented amount of standardization in the process, tools, and methodology. Less well defined is how end user, administrator, and developer documentation is done. As it turns out, not only can tech writers adapt to Agile, they can thrive in this environment!  <hr>
<a href="mailto:thomas_spetnagel@valpak.com">Thomas A Spetnagel</a>:  (Valpak) From experience, agile is clearly the best strategy to employ for developing software. It focuses on delivering the best value to the stakeholders at the best time, and fully embraces the necessary-and-vital collaborative nature of software development. It&#39;s hard to believe that software was ever developed any other way. <hr>
<a href="mailto:npf@pghfirm.com">Noah Paul Fardo</a>:  (<a href="http://pghfirm.com/">Flaherty Fardo, LLC</a>) Simple yet Solid.  I fully support the simple, yet solid principles of the Manifesto.  The Manifesto states the obvious and most efficient vehicle for software development and more importantly customer satisfaction. Well done.

<b>Jagan Muttasseril</b>: The four basic values are ones that each of us must find a way to balance. I believe the farther we are able to lean to the left the more satisfied our customers will be. <hr>

<a href="mailto:michaelkuesters@hotmail.com">Michael Küsters</a>:  (<a href="http://www.se-co.de/layer2/about-us/our-team/michael-kuesters/">SE-Consulting</a>) As an IT-oriented Six Sigma Master Black Belt, I can say that the Agile Manifesto joins the best practices of Quality Management with those of Software development.

Only 1% of what makes us agile is the manifesto - 99% is our attitude towards it:
We must continuously work for the realization of these values and principles - and never be content with how much we have accomplished.<hr>

<b>Greg Hutchinson</b>: All methodologies can work, this simply works better than the rest.<hr>
<a href="mailto:howard@spotify.com">Howard Smith</a>:  (Spotify) <td width="233"><a href="mailto:harold.parker.ctr@ustranscom.mil">Harold Parker</a>:  (<a href="http://www.deams.org">http://www.deams.org</a>) Although Agile software development focuse on human capital versus processes and tools, it is the dedicated human capital which proactively discern trends, risks, and issues and offer mitigation steps in advance of problems manifesting themselves.  The human resource must perform program analysis and real quality control during software development to preclude excessive software errors during testing.  Extensive techinical and functional expertise is available and when used properly in Agile development, it will lessen the dependence on tools and ensure the tool is only a tool and nothing more.  Agile development principles focus on the desired outcome with faster response times and delivery to customers and less on waiting to receive answers after populating a tool.  Agile development is about results.  A tool which provides an answer months later has no value in the global marketplace or the highly competitive government or commercial business environments.  Time is money and in these austere funding environments, agile development will assure all resources are effectively used with minimal waste.<hr>

It feels great to be part of Signataries...

Long Live Agile Manifesto!, Long Live true agile community!<hr>
<b>Christine Springer</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ForeclosureIndustryNews.com">Desert Edge Legal Services, LLC</a>) As a business owner, I agree with the principles of the Manifesto. Businesses should return to face to face communication. Technology should not replace human interaction. In today&#39;s business world, rapidly changing situations are a daily reality and it is important to remain flexible. I appreciate the Manifesto&#39;s expression of values and apply them in my own business.<hr>
<b>Terry Matthews</b>:  (<a href="http://www.monkeymediasoftware.com">MonkeyMedia Software</a>) In the many years I have been working as both a programmer and as a manager of software development projects, I always seem to come back to these guiding principles. I find them truly inspirational.<hr>

<b>Designer Boutique Menswear</b>:  (<a href="http://www.designerboutique-online.com/all-clothing/creative-recreation/">Creative Recreation Trainers</a>) I endorse the Agile Manifesto and back it 100%. From Designer Boutique Menswear.<hr>
<b>E.R.Acharya</b>:  (Mathematics teacher)  It is an approach that best satisfies everyone&#39;s goals on a teaching- learning &amp; software project... in the most timely and cost effective manner. Initiative Owners get what they want; quick, quality solutions at the lowest possible price. Domain experts get what they want; solutions that solve their problems. On the other hand through this manifesto we should exchange our experieces to each other for further development.Lets move in the scientific worlds.<hr>

<a href="mailto:vfursov@gmail.com">Vitaliy Fursov</a>: I respect agile principles and I love the results. I live in a farmland, and I see many nice old barns that rises above new developments. People built them following same principles as agile community does. The majority of these barns were built by same people (neighbors), all of them are custom structures, reflecting individual needs, developed at several iterations, and always have room for improvements. These barns are 150-200 years old, but still strong, and functional.<hr>

<b>Olivia Segovia</b>: I support the Agile Manifesto before this exist, I said that because in general all the principles behind the Manifesto were always present in my work. I do a master degree in Quality Assurance at the end of the 1980, just some people was interesting in the subject in that time, now is a topic who all the companies are very motivating. I was a teacher at the university too and the majority of this principles was explain by myself to my students, I hope some of them remembers now what we discuss together, one’s of the most important were :
“The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.”
“Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.”
I congratulate all of you for the idea to work together and finally put in paper the best ideas, experiences and knowledge you have. I expect this Manifesto will be show to all the students of Software Engineering.<hr>

You can&#39;t stop the change!

<a href="mailto:bobevans19@carolinux.com">Bob Evans</a>:  (<a href="http://www.carolinux.com">carolinux</a>) I&#39;ve spent a lifetime in IT. I finally see a methodology that I adhere to...<hr>
<a href="mailto:matias.iacono@gmail.com">Matias Iacono</a>.<hr>
<a href="mailto:valko@hotmail.co.uk">Valko Yotov</a>:  (Infosys Technologies Ltd.) My favorite are:

DRY - Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unamiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

Program close to the problem domain. Design and code in your user&#39;s language.
Use a project glossary. Create and mainain a single source for all the specific terms and vocabulary for a project.

Design with contracts: Use contracts to document and verify that the code does no more and no less than it claims to do.

Use assertions to validate your assumptions and contracts. 

Crash early and crash often - the broken assertions enable to crash early and point to the root cause.

Automate - continuous integration via automated end to end integration testing.

Prefer composition to inheritance: Tight coupling is undesirable and should be avoided where possible. 

Break dependencies by abstraction - mock all interfaces.<hr>

<a href="mailto:martinsporto@gmail.com">Frederico Martins Porto</a>: I&#39;m from Cabo Frio, a city from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. The agile principles are changing my mind. I&#39;m learning more and more how to build software in a better way!<hr>

<a href="mailto:zechmane@grangeinsurance.com">Eric Zechman</a>.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:a.elomari@decizia.com">Abdel ELOMARI</a>:  (<a href="http://www.decizia.com">Decizia</a>) As a consultants, we applied agile data warehousing in a big BI/DW project here in morocco. At the begining the customer was a bit &quot;scared&quot;, but when deployed the first release after 6 weeks (including Hard/Soft install and config) the users was very satisfied... We continued using this approach for the whole project and that was just successfull...

Thanks to anyone that helped and still helps to promote and organise this approach.<hr>
<b>Praveen George</b>:  (<a href="http://www.crimsoncomputing.com">Crimson Computing Solutions LLC</a>) We pledge our allegiance to the values that agile development espouse!<hr>
<b>Vijay Ganti</b>:  (<a href="http://www.mamigo.us">Mamigo </a>) Having worked with the waterfall model for several years, Agile for last 3 years has been a great change from a Product Management perspective. Product Managers always look for working software as that is the only way to see if the customers needs are being met. Traditional development model don&#39;t provide anything useful in the hands of the Product Manager for months and even years and in a fast changing world software runs the risk of being incorrect and irrelevant. As an entrepreneur Agile principles were natural to us and have yielded results. While Agile doesnt make a bad business good it does help get better and correct products out. <hr>
<b>Maurice Carey</b>:  (<a href="http://www.apollogrp.edu/">Apollo Group</a>) Success shifted me toward practicing these principles but the failures I&#39;ve witnessed without them have cemented them as practices that cannot and will not be ignored.<hr>
<a href="mailto:ssa.carvalho@uol.com.br">Sergio de Souza Aguiar Carvalho</a>:  (Embraer) I am coordinating the introduction of Scrum at Embraer IT department. We are very excited to initiate our first Sprints ... <hr>
<b>Michaux Kelley</b>:  (<a href="http://webamused.wordpress.com/">http://webamused.wordpress.com/</a>) Having worked in Agile for the past year, I confirm and support the statements made in the manifesto. Not only is Agile pragmatic, but it has also been effective in yielding high-quality software and fomenting teamwork in my organization as well as those with whom I&#39;ve been fortunate to collaborate. I extend my endless appreciation to all engineers endeavoring to promote Agile throughout the industry.<hr>

Agile methodology is the best and really impressed with the scrum call and customer collaboration.

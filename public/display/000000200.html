<b>Sean WIllison</b>:  (Abstract Design Solutions L.L.C.) <hr>
<b>Justin Souter</b>:  (<a href="http://souterconsulting.eu">Souter Consulting Limited</a>) Have recently completed the DSDM Atern intro to agile project management, and am a big fan!

Also interested to see how agile can be rolled out in the wider organisation to increase business flexibility, and yes - agility! ;-)

Bring it on :-)<hr>
<b>Brian Boelsterli</b>:  (<a href="http://www.creoss.com">CREOSS</a>) This Manifesto truly marked the beginning of a major transformation and paradigm shift in the industry. We presented a case study at the very first Agile Conference in 2003 (Salt Lake City),using Paceline(formerly &quot;Rhythm&quot;), a blending of Scrum/XP/Lean/Kanban. It has been truly gratifying to be able to add value to our client base&#39;s ecosystems leveraging the Manifesto. We would have liked to see a 5th core value--Aligning business and technology over IT-driven business solutions.<hr>
<b>James Rosko</b>: I&#39;ve been using Scrum in my software org for a couple of years and I&#39;ll never go back to the old way.<hr>

<a href="mailto:mumale@gmail.com">Mahesh Umale</a>:  (<a href="http://www.master-mindtech.com">Master Mind Technologies</a>) We followed AGILE methodology in developing projects including ERP, CRM, e-Commerce and other software projects.
We found it greatly help in understanding progress of project, risk assessment as well as increases interaction and feel good in TEAM.
It reduced dullness and pumps energy in TEAM.
Its SIMPLY GREAT<hr>
<b>Andrey Levchenko</b>:  (Asuns) Trying to follow these principals for many years I truly believe this is the way for productive software development and customer satisfaction!<hr>
<b>Brian (Bientek)</b>:  (<a href="http://www.bientek.com/">Bientek</a>) Responding to change is becoming is becoming increasingly important.<hr>
<b>Daniel CHIARAMELLO</b>: I realized I followed many of Agile Manifesto values during my professional life before knowing its existence... I felt alone doing that - I fell less alone now!<hr>
<b>Alexandre Corrêa Barbosa</b>:  (<a href="http://log4dev.com">http://log4dev.com</a>) <hr>
<b>Mary Lissa Articona</b>: We are now using Agile in our projects <hr>
<b>Samuel Komfi</b>: Using it as part of my rails, django and yii projects. Evolution.<hr>
<a href="mailto:andy@claroh.com">Andrew Hearse</a>.<hr>
<b>David Paulsen</b>:  (IBM) In my many years of software development and consulting, I&#39;ve came to many of the same conclusions that are proclaimed in the Agile Manifesto.

To me, Agile takes software engineering processes/concepts and applies a healthy dose of reality to it. This results in an approach to software development that actually works! <hr>

It is a great and simple way to find joy in coding again. <hr>
<a href="mailto:alessandro@direccioncreativa.es">alessandro</a>:  (<a href="http://www.direccioncreativa.es">dirección creativa</a>) The AGILE manifesto could be as well the basis for a meaningful UNE 166002<hr>
<a href="mailto:samrakesh@in.ibm.com">Rakesh Pilli</a>:  (IBM India) Agile is definitely the way forward for developing and implementing solutions of any kind. One major challenge would be to spread this change to different cultures all around the world.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mcgheep7@yahoo.com">Paul McGhee</a>:  (Pfizer Inc) The Agile way of working effectively deals with the reality of providing systems for business users.  They don&#39;t know exactly what they want until they see it.  Then when they do see it they quickly think of something even better.  As one of my former managers often remarked &quot;reality wins&quot;.<hr>
<b>R Krishna Kumar</b>: Extremely sensible methodology to achieve progress in the real-world<hr>
<a href="mailto:felipeibg@yahoo.com.br">Felipe da Silva</a>:  (<a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM Brazil</a>) Definitely the most important thing is the customer satisfaction, to delivery valuable software prioritizing the quality together with agility for customer&#39;s competitive advantage. The Agile Manifesto brings up a real partnering with all the customers, accepting challenges and trusting in the individuals, keeping in mind that who make the job are people and not tools. I believe in this manifesto because it really works in the real world.<hr>

<b>AJ Weaver</b>:  (<a href="http://www.agilethought.com">AgileThought</a>) Not only does agile make development fun again, it gives instant gratification to the stake holders who can see their product evolve over each iteration.  Its a win/win for both developers and for the business.

&#39;Nuff said.<hr>

<a href="mailto:driftboatdave@gmail.com">Dave Harrison</a>:  (Columbia Sportswear) I love the Agile Manifesto!

Agile development is our favored way of working. We subscribe to agile development principles, which includes the following points:
a) Change is OK. We expect the scope and deliverables to change mid-project based on the needs of the business.
b) Frequent releases and Continuous Integration are important to me. Success = working software. 
c) Business people and developers must work together daily to succeed. Face to face meetings are always best, followed by voice communications, last - email.
d) In terms of project management, we feel that the best teams are self-organizing teams. We believe in building projects around motivated individuals, giving them the tools and support they need, and trusting them to get the work done.
e) We will pay continuous attention to process and technical improvements. Reflection and change is a part of our work. 
f) Simplicity = maximizing the work not done = success.<td width="233"><b>Henry Cruzado</b>:  (<a href="http://www.acesoftware.fr">ACE Software</a>) <hr>
<a href="mailto:RichardFisher.IT@gmail.com">Richard Fisher</a>:  (Fisher Designs) I have been an &#39;Agile&#39; designer and developer for a number of years, and know that the more of these principles that are followed, the better the results.<hr>
<b>Joachim Mreyen</b>: You cannot replace interaction between people by following a strict process. Real achievments are accomplished were people from different areas work towards a common goal.<hr>
<a href="mailto:kunthar@gmail.com">Kunthar</a>:  (<a href="http://www.kunthar.com">http://www.kunthar.com</a>) I believe that agile way is a best way to develop software. It is a need, not only for customers, but for a high quality software product.<hr>

<b>Russel Lopez</b>.<hr>
<b>Iñaki Idigoras Igartua</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ulmaembedded.com">ULMA Embedded Solutions</a>) We are a startup design house in the embedded arena. We do both hard and soft design. As we put in practice what the manifesto says, we recognize its true value, not only for software development, but also for business development.

We seek becoming a professional service company, and without doubt, the manifesto will guide us in the right direction.

Thanks for the light!<hr>
<a href="mailto:everweij@me.com">Erwin Verweij</a>:  (<a href="http://www.verzinmaarwat.nl">VerzinMaarWat</a>) As a user of Scrum and endorser of Lean Management. I stand for the Agile Manifesto. I believe it is a successful way to starting working and doing the things that matter. Don&#39;t waste energy and time. Keep it lean and mean.<hr>
<b>Deyanira Araujo</b>:  (Infosys - Mexico) Agile really changes the way of developing software. I totally support the Agile Manifesto!<hr>
<b>James R. Bracy</b>:  (<a href="http://waratuman.com">http://waratuman.com</a>) Committed to technical excellence while at the same time working with people and responding to their needs.<hr>
<a href="mailto:mtdeloera@gmail.com">Jose M. De Loera</a>.<hr>
<b>Ian Joyner</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ianjoyner.name">Harmonic Systems</a>) I have never rushed to endorse agile and now do so after many years. I appreciate the thought and expertise that has gone into it. We used to struggle against traditional engineering management in the 80s and 90s, but Agile has provided us with well-researched material to show the point.

For Agile - it&#39;s not that it&#39;s new - it&#39;s just now explained well.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jimmy.ajuwa@jacagroup.com">Jimmy Ajuwa</a>:  (<a href="http://www.jacagroup.com">Jacagroup</a>) Making the user and customer  part of the team is one excellent way of enhancing product acceptance.Just enough planning is so ideal to deliver on time and within budget.Excessive documentation and lack of same could cripple organizations and projects.
Go Agile!<hr>

<b>Parker Lord</b>: I have been involved with projects using Agile for quiet some time and it has worked much better than the more structured methodologies. The important thing to keep in mind is the first part of the statement, in that there is still value in the items on the right, specially to business people!<hr>
<a href="mailto:rboelter@nozzzs.com">Robert Boelter</a>:  (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rfboelter">dba NoZZZs</a>) Agile principals are founded on achieving productivity through collaboration.  They are applied through trust-based relationships that lead to ownership and accomplishment based on an understanding of business value.  <hr>

<a href="mailto: websitedevteam@metasystems.com">Neil</a>:  (<a href="http://metasystems.com/">Metasystems ERP Software</a>) The principles that Agile Manifesto is following are must for all businesses to be successful.These principles let people make confident and cost-efficient business decisions. You guys are doing a great Job. Keep up the good work. <hr>
<a href="mailto:ocular@rlbencin.com">Neil</a>:  (<a href="http://rlbencin.com/">Call Center Consultants</a>) Agility is what drives one’s success.  These principles are not proposed Silver Bullets but a pragmatic and functional set of practices that will completely metamorphose your organization into a successful one. Great work. All the best....Cheers<hr>
<b>Ranvir Singh Mourya</b>: I second these thoughts as instead of giving value to processes we should give more value to technical, behavioral and functional aspect of project.
Because at the end it doesn’t matter how much document, how much process you prepared or followed, only matter is that your creation fulfill the requirement and satisfy the end user.
If you are a developer/Story writer/Builder, you have to do things as per your customer not as per the process you have set to get your customer satisfaction.<hr>

<a href="mailto:alberto.patino.limon@gmail.com">Alberto Patino</a>:  (<a href="http://knowledgefrontier.blogspot.com">http://knowledgefrontier.blogspot.com</a>) <td width="233"><b>David Braund</b>: I believe agile methods are good throughout a project but they are especially good at the front end of a project. Many projects fail, particularly large ones in the public sector (and many in the public sector are very large) because in the rush to procurement, requirements are not fully discussed and understood by all the parties involved. Agile methods can allow most of the &#39;baby-stuff&#39; mistakes to be spotted and avoided early on.<hr>
<b>Stefan Wagner</b>:  (<a href="http://www.bayer.net.au">Bayer Pty Ltd</a>) We intentionally do not offer fixed-price project proposals, as they are deemed outdated and inferior to an adaptive, iterative approach, yielding a much better quality outcome for the client. With the adaptive planning approach clients see their application system grow and mature, giving them a better feeling of control and
confidence. The iterative approach demands a much higher level of project &amp; development interaction from client staff, allowing them continued input. Specifications become living documents, rather than an inflexible commitment as a result of the scope lock-in, being part of the fixed-price proposal. The main issue with fixed prices proposals is that any change in requirements and circumstances results in a costly change request, which eventually makes the project considerably more expensive than it has to be. Further, the iterative approach also prepares and embraces change, which allows for earlier stage releases of project iterations.<hr>

<a href="mailto:yang.xiao@bbc.co.uk">Yang Xiao</a>:  (<a href="http://bbc.co.uk/rd">BBC R&D</a>) Agile Software Development is the only way forward. Software development is a design process rather than a construction process. <hr>
<a href="mailto:rsherwood1@googlemail.com">Rob Sherwood</a>.<hr>
<b>Steven Fram</b>:  (<a href="http://www.caring.com/">Caring.com</a>) Scrum and Agile have revolutionized my work at start-ups, including at BabyCenter and Caring.com.  As a founder of Caring.com, Scrum/Agile were required elements of our culture/process literally from Day 1.<hr>
<a href="mailto:fjoberkamp@oberkamp.com">F.J. Oberkamp</a>: The agile methodology is the only reasonable concept to define the exact needs and expectations of the stakeholders/shareholders allowing for the delivery of a functional and useful end product.  It also provides a direct communications flow that handles issues revolving around &quot;expectation management&quot;.  It is an evolved processes set that aptly illustrates the elimination of the old story of the 8 elements involved of what the customer actually wanted.

Agile, if properly utilized, virtually eliminates the issues of the human interface to technology being so difficult for the average human to deal with.  If the initial homework to define the true needs of the actual end users has been performed correctly, agile will deliver an appropriate product without all the &quot;techno speak&quot; of many final products.  Instead of focusing on squeezing a client into a predefined &quot;box&quot;, the method concentrates on using development tools and procedures to deliver a final product that will be used to its fullest extent because it makes sense to the humans.

 Software, applications and systems are only as good as the functions they provide to the humans and the flexibility and scalability they provide for the future.  With the use of the agile methodology, all the parties have an equal understanding of what is required and what is possible.  With proper management of the methodology, this will come as close to assuring success and a mutually beneficial delivery as is possible.  Always remember that the end result is only as good as the input and assessment thereof.<hr>

<b>Kevin Bolam</b>: As a student i am taught the difference between Agile methodologies and others. And as a consiquence seen (although in a smiulated enviroment) that Agile is the best process in which to deliver quality software to a customer quickly and efficiantly<hr>
<b>Roy F. Donasco</b>: Agile for most people who have not experienced it is just a buzz word. To me it&#39;s a mindset and software development lifestyle that encourages team work, communication, flexibility, and adaptability to business changes.<hr>

<b>Srinivas Sirigina</b>:  (<a href="http://www.sirigina.com">SSI Inc</a>) Agile is a great paradigm shift in software development. I agree that most of the requirements are written in the very beginning of project and are never updated 100%. I am all for skipping the detailed requirements and go with brief use cases, mind maps and collaboration with business users. <hr>
<a href="mailto:lancerkind@yahoo.com">Lance Kind</a>:  (<a href="http://LancerKind.com">http://LancerKind.com</a>) I&#39;ve been doing this since Kent Beck got his hands on me in 1999.  The manifesto can be applied to your life well beyond software development.  I&#39;ve applied this to writing fiction, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how this can be applied to government.  This philosophy makes so much sense that since I&#39;ve learned it, I&#39;ve never wanted to do waterfall again.  So I&#39;ve been coaching developers and organizations about how to do this.  (In an official consulting capacity or not.)  Now I might as well make it official by signing the document.  Plus saying you&#39;ve signed a manifesto is cool!  ;-)   

==&gt;Lancer---<hr>
<a href="mailto:tpodolsk@amfam.com">Tim Podolske, CSM</a>:  (<a href="http://www.amfam.com">American Family Insurance</a>) Quite a paradox. Simple, yet complex. <hr>
<a href="mailto:armistral@gmail.com">Armistral</a>:  (<a href="http://marketwatch.com">News Corporation</a>) Independent of any specific methodology the manifesto does a great job of defining some practical ways to do great work, especially by empowering teams and team members to do their best work (actually writing good code) rather than getting lost in non-essentials and distractions.

9 years on this document still stands above any other singular philosophy I can find in terms of clarify, brevity and common sense.

Best Regards,

Armistral<hr>
<b>Nathan Frost</b>:  (GiantSparrow) The Agile Manifesto is the most concise -- yet complete -- definition of effective development philosophy I&#39;ve seen.

Truly a call to arms.<hr>
<a href="mailto:dax.miller@vgm.com">Dax Miller</a>:  (<a href="http://www.vgm.com/">The VGM Group, Inc</a>) History proves that advancement in software development and engineering is imminent. As we improve, we change our processes and workflow patterns to match the technical curve of our respective industry. One thing that does not change is the importance of Communication. The technical experts behind the processes and tools, as well as the customer/client and ultimate consumer that drives change with demand, feedback and suggestion. The Agile Manifesto keeps our perception of the future aligned with the fundamental truth of business...Communication. </td></tr></table><p><table align="center"><tr><td align="right" width="40%"><a href="000000171.html">&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;</a></td>

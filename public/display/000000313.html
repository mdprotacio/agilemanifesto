<a href="mailto:raj.kosaraju@gmail.com">Raj Kosaraju</a>:  (Maxil Technology Solutions Inc.) Agile’s modular nature means employing better suited object-oriented designs and programmes, which means one always has a working model for timely release even when it does not always entirely match customer specifications.I strongly favor three critical recommendations for selecting and deploying agile process solutions: empower business users, bridge the silos of the enterprise content infrastructure, and tightly integrate content and process technologies for satisfying compliance and performance monitoring.<hr>

<a href="mailto:melih.ozdemir@deturgroup.com">Melih Ozdemir</a>:  (<a href="http://www.deturgroup.com">Detur International</a>) Updating the Principles behind the Agile Manifesto;

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable solutions.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in the solution delivery lifecycle. Agile processes harness change for the stakeholder’s competitive advantage.

Deliver working solutions frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Stakeholders and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals.  Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a delivery team is face-to-face conversation.

Quantified business value is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development.  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Leverage and evolve the assets within your organizational ecosystem, and collaborate with the people responsible for those assets to do so.

Visualize workflow to help achieve a smooth flow of delivery while keeping work in progress to a minimum.

The organizational ecosystem must evolve to reflect and enhance the efforts of agile teams, yet be sufficiently flexible to still support non-agile or hybrid teams. <hr>

<b>Leonel More</b>:  (<a href="http://www.leonelmore.com">www.uruguayit.com</a>) The Agile Manifesto is a cornerstone of modern software development. In spite of the ideas were out there time before the signature in Snowbird, the simple act of enhacing them through clarity and simplicity of the manifesto made the difference.<hr>
<a href="mailto:Bhawnaramanan@gmail.com">Bhawna Ramanan</a>: People interaction and constant evolution are the only way to deliver value in today&#39;s data driven world.<hr>
<a href="mailto:monaphillips@hotmail.com">Romona Phillips</a>: Agile wins over the old hat SDLC waterfall. Hopefully more companies will adopt and support Agile development. <hr>

<b>Wayne Peacock</b>: The sheer number of people that evangelise Agile software development is a good measure of how successful the Agile manifesto is. And most, if not all, of those people have a real passion for it too. I definitely include myself as an Agilist. Spread the word people!<hr>

<b>Olivier Hoareau</b>:  (<a href="http://www.phppro.fr">PHPPRO</a>) Agile manifesto has changed my life (personal and professional).

Agile is becoming more and more one great answer for business-level problem/project.

Hoping that more and more individuals and companies will join the Agile Manifesto.

<b>Todd Pellizzer, PMP</b>:  (Interactive Data) It took a few years and an annual convention or 2 to completely embrace the Agile way of life, but I now can&#39;t imagine how I got a single product to market before Agile.<td width="233"><b>Alex S. Brown, PMP IPMA-C</b>:  (<a href="http://rlprj.com">Real-Life Projects, Inc.</a>) Although my work often requires that I set up processes, tools, documentation, contracts, and plans, I absolutely endorse the notion that the &quot;items on the left&quot; are even more valuable than any of these things when running a software development project.<hr>

<b>Mauro Stepanoski</b>:  (<a href="http://www.heliusit.net">Helius Information Technology</a>) Through Agile I meet the natural way to work and interact with customers and individuals.
Just Like in Martial Arts, the natural way is the right way.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jamilu.ibrahim@gmail.com">Jamilu Ibrahim</a>:  (<a href="http://www.itivityglobal.com">Itivity Global Ltd</a>) It is a great approach to software development. It is simply wonderful. I cannot imagine the development of software in any other way, particularly if the focus of the exercise is customer/end user satisfaction. <hr>
<b>Karl Hak Kim Wong</b>: This approach does put human touch on software development.  As programmer we must treasure the collaboration with our major stakeholders, the customers who are also the users of the software that we develop.<hr>

For my company I carries out the task of coordinating complex projects in which software applications are developed by us or developed by order.
My role is to define the product strategy that are developed within our software factory and sold to end customers.
The definition of the project, its organization and the conceptual and methodological approach of post-sales activities are jobs that I carry out every day.

<b>Natarajan Ramasamy</b>: It inspires!<hr>
<b>Amy Thorne</b>:  (<a href="http://programmergrrl.com">http://programmergrrl.com</a>) As &quot;agile&quot; moves mainstream, I am concerned that it&#39;s the practices doing so, but not the values and principles. Hence, I think it time for those, like me, who passively supported the manifesto in the past to proclaim their support now, helping agile adopters understand that &quot;being agile&quot; means more than just having iterations, daily stand-up meetings, backlogs, and such-like.<hr>
<b>Pavan Janga</b>:  (Capgemini) People are more important than process to produce working S/W as required by the market with change&#39;s inevitable.Agile works... I&#39;m with it. <hr>
<b>Florin Oprea</b>.<hr>
<b>Dyaneshwaran P</b>: AGILITY is all about &#39;being&#39;. You can&#39;t do AGILE; but you can be AGILE ! I truly support the Agile Manifesto for it&#39;s 4 values and 12 principles. These values and principles guide the team in delivering real value for their customers (not some crap). It also makes the team motivated/empowered since they are &#39;trusted&#39; to get the job done. Of course the team is provided with the required  environment and support ! <hr>

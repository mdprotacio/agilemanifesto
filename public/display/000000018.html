I am, however, in the process of founding a software company that seeks to achieve a number of things that I have found echoed in your principles of Agile Software Development.

I envisage that my small company will attempt to encapsulate the communitarian ethos of the the free and open source software communities, specialising in re-cycled code, teamwork and the development of a &quot;development bio-rhythm&quot;
which will be viewed as a kind of emergent property shared between the client and Software Sculptures where both contribute openly, freely and interpret the final sculptures continuously as it takes form.  For this reason, I would like to try to stir up a trend of pricing software for the hours and creativity involved in its creation rather than for the code underneath.  And of course, our code shall be open and available.

Thank you all for the encouragement you have afforded me.  And with your permissions, i shall certainly intend to make use of the Agile Software Principles in the creation of a genuinely creative and transparent environment at Software Sculptures.<hr>

<a href="mailto:Dave.Sheremata@iona.com">J. Dave Sheremata</a>:  (<a href="http://www.iona.com">IONA Technologies, PLC</a>) Having been an XP zealot for a couple of years now, the Agile Manifesto is even more beautiful in that it is stated more simply than other contemporary development practices.  Because it is concise and more refined, it is easier for the disciples of more rigid practices to begin to question and understand than the more elaborate web of XP or RUP.
Cheers to evolution!<hr>

<a href="mailto:drkretz@comcast.net">Donald Kretz</a>: Over the years, I have wasted too much time producing reams of documentation that no one ever read, and building software that no one ever used.  Customer interaction and prototyping has been the key to our recent success.  This is the way to go!<hr>

<a href="mailto:jonathan.logan@merant.com">Jonathan Logan</a>:  (<a href="http://www.Merant.com">Merant Corporation</a>) Quality development and delivery requires an organizational and individual commitment to deep listening to the customers and to each other, to on going process improvement, an unending willingness and flexibility to learn &amp; grow, and the full access to and use of only the best tools, resurces and practices.  

All the best of success!

donV<td width="233"><a href="mailto:agile@jdtangney.com">John Tangney</a>:  (<a href="http://jdtangney.com">JD Tangney & Assoc.</a>) As a specialist in web-based applications, I cannot conceive of any viable alternative to an Agile process. For decades, we Software practioners have struggled with various Processes and Methodologies which purport to decrease defect rates and improve time to market. In almost all instances, those Processes and Methodologies impose artifical and unnatural constraints on all participants, stiffling whatever creative spirit we might bring to the defect and schedule problems. Simply put, Agile processes don&#39;t. Instead, they encourage what we do well and put in place safety nets to save us from those areas in which we [humans] don&#39;t do as well.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jared@hatwhite.com">Jared Smith</a>:  (<a href="http://www.hatwhite.com">White Hat</a>) Thank God for this agile manifesto! A ray of light streaming out over the software industry. As a person who strives continually in an environment where people think these ideas are unworkable, I&#39;m grateful to find a simple and clear place on the web to point people, adding context to my earnest appeal for user-centered software. Please note that software according to the agile principles is software in alignment with the great commandment to love our neighbor; other methods cause us to contend instead of search for the virtues of practical humility.<hr>

<a href="mailto:johnswolter@wolterworks.com">John Wolter</a>:  (Wolter Works) The Agile Manifesto&#39;s values offer to any development an opportunistic dynamic interaction that extends not just to technical work but to the business side of any product.  Agile gives freedom from perscriptive plans and processes that strangle taking dynamic advantage of emerging technical opportunities and changes.  

Agile Development is not anarchy, it, for each project, defines a flexible fair playing field through declaritive constraints where the best results can emerge. It is creativity with focus, process when needed, goals with exploration, collaboration with individual accomplishment, and constant evolutionary optimumization of results to meet project needs. <hr>
<a href="mailto:poip@sympatico.ca">Patrick Parato</a>:  (Compression Software) I have been meaning to add my name to this list for a long time. Agile methodologies make developing kick-ass software fun again. Giving the customer the control they deserve, letting the programmer just do thier job, and building a strong team of people who work well together, just makes sense. How come other methodologies don&#39;t realize this!<hr>

<b>Tom Godbold</b>: Great work.<td width="233"><a href="mailto:cstump@bellatlantic.net">Charles W. Stump II</a>: After many years of software development in both product and project environments, I am convinced that Agile is the key to success. I am also convinced that Agile development and monolithic processes such as CMMI can coexist if people recognize the benifits of both. <hr>
<a href="mailto:dak@dotech.com">David Kavanagh</a>: I&#39;m glad others share the same values for software development. I almost thought documenting it went against &quot;agile&quot;, but you did keep it brief and to the point! :-)<hr>

<b>Anthon Pang</b>:  (<a href="http://www.softwaredevelopment.ca">http://www.softwaredevelopment.ca</a>) It is fear of the items on the left under adverse conditions that the items on the right have dominated traditional methods of developing software.  Complementing these values are those from XP: communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.<hr>
<a href="mailto:Agile@CandlerPark.com">Louis Garrett</a>:  (<a href="http://www.DatabaseHelp.net">DatabaseHelp.net</a>) Thanks for formalizing a way out of Dilbert&#39;s world for teams who can successfully produce software without first writing a novel or demanding one from the customer.  
I was previously frustrated by serial processes and the uncertainty that the industry could invent lightweight alternatives.  
I can now be frustrated by the knowledge that strong alternatives exist, but they&#39;re not understood or embraced by my clients or coworkers.
After suffering under the label &quot;cowboy coder&quot; for so long, it&#39;s nice to find respected voices who confirm that it&#39;s possible to build great software by quickly building good software that evolves toward greatness.  
I&#39;ll contribute these tired refrains to the group from my limited bag of tricks:
&quot;They won&#39;t know what they want until we show them something they don&#39;t want.&quot;
&quot;We can&#39;t expect them to drive up and order software like they would a burger and fries.  It&#39;s easy to imagine a burger with either ketchup or mustard.  It&#39;s hard to imagine robust software systems.  Let&#39;s stop expecting wildly creative visions in the early stage when they&#39;re not likely or necessary.&quot;<hr>
<b>F. Andy Seidl</b>:  (<a href="http://myst-technology.com">MyST Technology Partners</a>) I became an ardent &quot;agilist&quot; (is there such a word?) about two years ago when I read Robert K. Weiler&#39;s opinion piece in Information Week (http://www.informationweek.com/830/30uwrw.htm).<hr>
<a href="mailto:akg74@hotmail.com">Arun Kumar</a>:  (ADP) This addresses to a certain extent the important issue of alignment between IT and Business. As an IT community, we haven&#39;t earned the trust from Business that we could not only deliver but could also drive the business.

Agile methodology is the way to go and this has the potential to solve the productivity paradox.<hr>

<b>Juan Felipe Machado Guzman</b>:  (<a href="http://www.tesamerica.com">TES America</a>) After a lot of tries with processes, I finally found a metodology for small groups, that guaranties quality and don&#39;t compromise delivery times. Thanks!!! <hr>
<a href="mailto:eelco_hillenius@yahoo.com">Eelco Hillenius</a>: This is how it should be! In my experience though, it&#39;s still the commercial people selling projects to commercial people using commercial arguments (crap mostely) instead of realistic arguments. Dilbert&#39;s world is still in effect as long as the buying process does not change.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jmshort2@hotmail.com">Joe Short</a>:  (<a href="http://12.34.195.35/default/index.jsp;jsessionid=OS4FCMH3DDIMDLAZBYZSFEY?pageid=gov_index&branchid=gov">AT&T Government Solutions</a>) Agile engineering methodologies are a natural evolution from the current traditional framework approach.  My hope is that we realize a concurrent transformation in the Configuration Management and Quality Assurance disciplines as well, resulting in transparent and complete product assurance that is woven into the product&#39;s lifecycle.<hr>

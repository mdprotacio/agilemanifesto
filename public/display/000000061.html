<a href="mailto:full2njoy@gmail.com">Philip</a>:  (<a href="http://philip9876.rediffblogs.com">http://philip9876.rediffblogs.com</a>) Attended the &quot;Lotusphere comes to you -2006&quot; in Singapore and had the opportunity to hear about this initiative from Alan and Steephan. Its a refreshing change to hear this initiative rather than the same old marketing stuff that a company tries to drill into our minds. A different approach towards looking at problems and hopefully achieving results in a better way. Cheers.

<a href="mailto:gbergeron13@gmail.com">Gary Bergeron</a>:  (CCI) The hardest issue in implementing Agile that I have encountered is in the sales cycle.  Most people (especially Project Managers) are not ready to hear:
- The overall project will probably never be done
- Sorry but your customers desire to have their requirements conveyed in a few sessions is really just a pipe dream
- Agile is a fundamental shift in the we think. The process itself is not revolutionary, it&#39;s in the attitude.  Kind of Zen like.

To get the sale we often sell out the principles of Agile only to try to work them in once we have the contract.  Not good.<hr>

<b>Eduardo Mercovich</b>:  (<a href="http://inspiro.com.ar">GaiaSur inSpiro</a>) After years of trying to force predictive (traditional engineering) methods with variable results, I discovered the agile, or adaptative, circa 1999. 

These agile methods are useful not only for software development but for almost any project in which the first order variables are not predictable. 

Since I usually work with people in projects that are new (because of it&#39;s ideas or because they were previously not done by their organization), I have found this view very useful and invaluable many times in the last years. 

I do support completely the agile methodology and it&#39;s primary values. 

Thanks a lot for your inspiring work... :-)<hr>

<a href="mailto:agileManifesto@michaelmahlberg.de">Michael Mahlberg</a>:  (<a href="http://www.michaelmahlberg.de">independent consultant</a>) To me the agile manifesto is the essence of all the &quot;common sense&quot; practices that made projects successful in  the past decades. It&#39;s one of the best ways to strengthen practical approaches in software engineering and establish a new understanding of the field.<hr>

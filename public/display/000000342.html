<b>Alastair Thomson</b>:  (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insitute) As Chief Information Officer at the NHLBI, I am committed to changing the way the US Federal Government develops software by implementing Agile principles throughout my organization from Agile software development to incorporating Agile thinking into everything we do. Working with acquisitions experts, I am seeking to find solutions to the problem of contracting Agile software development while remaining true to the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  And no, it&#39;s not impossible!<hr>

<a href="mailto:dzolinski@messa.org">Dave Zolinski</a>:  (MESSA) Agile development practices have changed our organization. Projects come in on time, within budgets, and meets expectations of our customers.  Our development teams are happier and overall work experiences are better.
Many reasons but overall it is the communication aspects and the team buy in that aided in our transformation.  Expectations change and we can change with it swiftly.<hr>
<b>Rajagopala Udupa</b>: Everybody earns their living by serving others. Some do it for commercial gains and some do it as philanthropy. At the core of serving others comes Individuals, Interactions, Collaboration, Responding to change and Outcome delivery. Cannot agree more with the manifesto.

It also helps the business to build software that works without having to wait for a long time.<hr>
<a href="mailto:info@marcoalbarelli.eu">Marco Albarelli</a>: Years ago I thought I was smarter than the Agile people. Turns out I was not so I converted to Agile too :)
It&#39;s been years now and it&#39;s been one of my best choices <hr>
<a href="mailto:dancrumb@gmail.com">Dan Rumney</a>: All too often, I&#39;ve seen teams fail to succeed with Agile methodologies, because they&#39;ve failed to understand and embrace the Manifesto (or, at least, its principles).

I&#39;ve also been lucky enough to coach a team who *are* living the principles and that team is flying!<hr>

<a href="mailto:bharat.sharma@monsoonconsulting.com">Bharat Sharma</a>:  (Monsoon Consulting) I whole heartily endorsed Agile manifesto and will do best of my ability to follow the agile principals  <td width="233"><a href="mailto:simon_chesney@yahoo.com">Simon Chesney</a>: In my experience, following Agile principles leads teams to be more empowered &amp; more accountable in general, and that in turn leads to better outcomes - including happier customers, developers and their collaborators. Iteration and regular reflection (for example, retrospectives) creates opportunity for experimentation, measurement and improvement in team practices and team dynamics. An emphasis on the significance of individuals and interactions tends also to engender a culture of mutual respect - both within and across team boundaries. And in the relative chaos of hyper-growth environments, an Agile approach provides a means to be as responsive as possible to rapidly emerging and changing requirements.<hr>
<a href="mailto:alves.julien83@gmail.com">Julien ALVES</a>:  (Virtual and Intelligent Information) I endorse the Agile Manifesto and hereby declare that throughout my career, from my current junior state until my very last day of work in relation with Software Development, I will apply it everyday and pass on the word around me.<hr>
<a href="mailto:Brahmanand_Patil@yahoo.co.in">Brahmanand Reddy Patil</a>: I have worked and seen the world of waterfall model, processes, V-Models within V-model. The Agile principles are so simple and easy to understand after having seen the expensive failures with the traditional models. An instance of a root-cause analysis of a field failure in the Waterfall model is a good example of the nightmare the team/s go through. The kind of discussions there are more to blame the rest of the teams or individuals in the process. However, with the responsibility and ownership existing in the Agile teams (Scrum teams), I am sure there is enough evidence that the team will work towards solution than the processes.<hr>

<b>Matthias Niete</b>:  (OIO - Orientation in Objects GmbH) <hr>
<a href="mailto:mrdmis@gmail.com">Mark Davis</a>: Working in IT across a multitude of industries I have seen an organic move to these practices.  Establishing effective solutions to the changing landscape through Agile principals provides clarity.<hr>

Fear brings out the worst in people.  Thank you for attempting to combat it in my industry.  

I hope some day they&#39;ll join us,
And the office will live as one.<hr>
<a href="mailto:james@annotech.com">James Lawrence</a>:  (<a href="http://www.annotech.com">AnnoTech Software Consultants</a>) We have been developing to an agile methodology long before it was put to paper.  This has been part and parcel of Annotech&#39;s RAD application Development process.

We have been educating our developers in the Agile methodology and are hoping to fully adopt and play a part in this Manefesto<hr>

<b>Shen, Shenghao</b>: It is wonderful!<hr>
<a href="mailto:santosh.sahoo@wipro.com">Santosh Kumar Sahoo</a>:  (<a href="http://wipro.co.in">Wipro Infotech</a>) I am fully in agreement with the Agile values. But the risk here is to be able to build the customer confidence. After winning the confidence of the customer, rest becomes easier. Communication in addition to credibility will play a major role in winning customer&#39;s trust<hr>
<a href="mailto:a9dec@yahoo.com">Aniruddha Shahasane</a>:  (USF) Agile processes is the need for the present and certainly future.<hr>
<a href="mailto:paulm@askowl.com.au">Paul Marrington</a>:  (<a href="http://askowl.com.au">Askowl Pty Limited</a>) The manifesto is a clear description of principles I have been working towards all my professional life.<hr>
<a href="mailto:paul.warren@sheffcol.ac.uk">Paul Warren</a>:  (The Sheffield College) Agile is the way forward, having used the methods for some years now and seeing what others have done, makes my decision of being a Agilest the right one.<hr>
<a href="mailto:alex@alterecosystem.com">Alexander Papanastassiou</a>:  (<a href="http://www.alterecosystem.com">Alter Eco</a>) This is all a matter of working for results in the real world rather than for compliance with rigid and artificial methodologies in Bureaucratistan. The excesses of the industrial age must be put behind us. It is time to accept the near-chaotic nature of our world. People are not machines and the software we build is ultimately designed to serve people...<hr>

After some hard projects trying to be ISO/CMM/RUP/etc well polished, I had discovered Agile Manifesto effort and now I have my faith in software development field back.

Hey, ho, lets go !

<b>Niels Bech Nielsen</b>:  (<a href="http://www.logical.dk">logical</a>) <hr>
<b>Mike Kenny</b>:  (inzanix) I believe that Agile Software Development has been around for a long time, though not in any formalized state. In my experience many projects were delivered along the lines of eXtreme Programming methodologies with the significant difference that the actual projects were terminated on time but followed by many patches, enhancements, revisions, etc. In effect they followed the principal of &#39;deliver often and deliver late&#39; rather than &#39;deliver often and deliver early&#39; which adhering to Agile Software Development would have allowed.<hr>
<b>Philippe Ombredanne</b>:  (<a href="http://www.nexb.com">nexB</a>) I guess I should have signed years ago.
Agility rocks.
Been a fan of it since late 1999.
Simple beats complex.<hr>

<b>Devendra Joshi</b>:  (Summit Information Technologies Ltd.) Changing customer requirements or even understanding them has always been a problem with software architects. Making customer an integrated part of development process makes agile development process worth following.<hr>

Davis</a>:  (<a href="http://www.cse.sc.edu/~jimdavis">University of South Carolina</a>) I teach undergraduate and graduate course in hardware and software engineering, as well as carry out research, in the areas covered by the Mainfesto.  The Manifesto represents an &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;holistic&quot; approach to the issues pertaining to project organization, application of project-related and artifact-centric methods, and the execution and subsequent tracking of effectiveness of the project team in meeting both artifact-related requirements and project-related objectives. <hr>
<b>Paul Hathaway</b>:  (<a href="http://www.ansto.gov.au/ansto/bragg/">ANSTO Bragg Institute</a>) There are those of us who are engineers and scientists first, and keen software developers second. To keep focus on the project goals, with the customer and team in an agile environment, is vital to our success and satisfaction that the work has been done well. This Manifesto is a guiding light.<hr>
<b>Michael Schader</b>:  (<a href="http://www.yellowhouseassociates.net">Yellow House Associates, LLC</a>) Recently I&#39;ve seen a number of backlash articles that attempt to impugn XP and other lightweight methodologies by focusing on pitfalls in particular situations.  They&#39;re missing the point.  The Agile basics are fundamentally impossible to argue with -- who&#39;s opposed to working software or customer collaboration?<hr>

<a href="mailto:arunmr980@yahoo.com">Arun</a>:  (SRC Software) What i like most about this is that it demands nothing that does not come natural to a programmer who love his or her work . It is on the whole a very natural and intuitive process .<hr>

<a href="mailto:n.samuel@usa.zensar.com">Navin Samuel</a>:  (<a href="http://www.zensar.com">Zensar Technologies Inc</a>) I subscibe 100% to the philosophy of Agile development. But I also realize that &quot;Processes &amp; Tools&quot;, &quot;Comprehensive Documentation&quot;, &quot;Contract Negotiation&quot; &amp; &quot;Following a Plan&quot; are absolutely necessary for success in the longer run. The only way to bring about a collaboration among these factors is by automating as much as possible the non value adding activities involved in these processes. We at Zensar are working towards the same. Our Solution BluePrint framework is a step in this direction.<hr>

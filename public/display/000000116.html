        software by doing it and helping others do it.

Along with our customers, my team is very happy by following this process, they are more enthusiastic and co-operative with each other.
Through Scrum, we are not only learning the way of developing working applications, we are also learning the Art of Leaving. :-)<hr>

<b>Chris Oltyan</b>: The most important bit of information I&#39;ve picked up in starting 5 companies and working at 10 startups can be summed up by saying &quot;things change, a lot, all the time&quot;.

<a href="mailto:bjones1@qwestoffice.net">Bryan Jones</a>:  (<a href="http://www.clin1.net">Clinical Software Solutions</a>) Short and to the point.  Well said.  There&#39;s nothing that beats a &quot;win-win&quot; scenario. 

It&#39;s not the Big that eat the Small; it&#39;s the Fast that eat the Slow.<hr>

<a href="mailto:mhatem@it-blocks.com">Moatasem Hatem</a>:  (<a href="http://www.it-blocks.com">IT-Blocks</a>) Although new, I think that the agile methodology can be very helpful in the development of the SW life cycle from requirements to the customer acceptance of the product. As it mainly focuses on the customer which(I think) is considered the biggest pain in the neck you may ever have through out the process.Moreover the idea of the developers collaboration increases the performance and the speed of the production though it may affect the quality a bit.<hr>

<a href="mailto:AgileAlliance@bettoni.org">Paolo Bettoni</a>:  (<a href="http://www.bettoni.org">Bettoni Software</a>) Go Agile! 

We have found out what the right thing to do is... let&#39;s do it! 

But nooooo, let&#39;s write a detailed documentation about every method and every variable name from here till the end of the world before we start implementing! 

(Oh, and I forgot, before writing  documentation, we should carefully document how documentation should be written)<hr>

Business and technology evoloves too quickly to subscribe to any other methodology. The waterfall and spiral methodolgies that I learned in school 12 years ago have gone the way of the Dodo Bird and Windows NT 4.0. Extinct!

<a href="mailto:meb@sixsq.com">Marc-Elian Begin</a>:  (<a href="http://www.sixsq.com">SixÂ²</a>) Around 2000... During dark times... when I was (again) at the office late in the evening, 
trying to figure a way out of the mess my team and I were in, with yet
another of those crazy waterfall firm-fixed-price software development
projects, riddled with misunderstandings on most fronts... I stumbled to 
the printer room, with a haze in my head, to pick-up a printout when I found
the &quot;Agile Manifesto&quot; in the out tray... Wow! I read it in one gulp... it 
was like seeing the light for the first time in a long time. I can&#39;t 
think of any written document having a more profound impact on my
professional life than these few lines. It meant that I was not alone!


I eventually left that company, but not after rejecting the established 
acceptance that &#39;death marching&#39; was the way. Discovering agile meant that 
working in high performing teams with involved customers was now the only 
acceptable way and nothing else is or will be acceptable again.


To this day I don&#39;t know who left the manifesto in the printer out-
tray... perhaps I should refer this to the X files  ;-)  ... if angels 
exist (this is from a convinced atheist!) this one is a good patron!


Thanks for opening my eyes and showing me a much better world to be in.<hr>

<a href="mailto:contact@korn.ch">Hans-Peter Korn</a>:  (<a href="http://www.korn.ch">KORN AG, Switzerland</a>) Starting as scientist (PhD) in nuclear physics for a couple of years afterwards I worked for many years as line- and project-manager in the IT-departements of financial &amp; air transport industries. Today, as C*O of KORN AG, I am doing OD-, PD- and Project Management consultancies, coaching, &amp;  lecturing on universities. My main focus   is on change-, cooperation- &amp; communication- processes in enterprises and complex projects based on my practical learnings and a lot of trainings in systemic management, solution focused work, systemic constellations, group psychotherapy, sociometry, sociodrama &amp; psychodraman - and, of course, &quot;agility&quot;.<hr>

<b>Kamal Wickramanayake</b>:  (<a href="http://www.swview.org/">Software View</a>) For almost all the projects, changing requirements are inevitable. Hence, the adaptive culture suggested by agile methods can outperform the value delivered by predictive methods.

A large project may not be well managed as a single agile project. However, the Agile Manifesto well distinguishes what many of us need from what many of us want - irrespective of the size.<hr>
<a href="mailto:jeffrey_j_vojtko@progressive.com">Jeff Vojtko</a>:  (<a href="http://www.progressivecommercial.com">Progressive Commercial Insurance</a>) I have been involved in software development projects that accomplished the goals, I have been involved in failed projects. I have been involved in projects that took 1-2 years to elevate, and I have been involved in quick hitters. (&lt; 3 months) And, from my eperience the Agile method of development is by-and-far much more of a team approach to accomplishing the goals. The Waterfall SDLC tends to be a us vs them mentality. (Business vs IT) And, that is not what teamwork is supposed to be like. You can have the best developers in the world and the best business people around. But, if the processes prevent efficient/effective interaction, you will end up with a delayed or failed project.<hr>
